<p class='c005'>I did not write this little book with the
intention of apologizing to the prospective
reader, so soon as I had done so, but with
the honest, I hope not egotistical, feeling
that I had something to say that was not
generally known. We live to learn and to
impart what we know to others, and I have
taken this method of giving my experience
in a pastime that is elevating, artistic in
every sense of the word, and a wholesome
relief from the cares of business.</p>

<p class='c006'>In regard to the work itself, I can show
samples of every thing of any importance
described or given in it. I have not made
all of the patterns given in the back part, for
that is mere routine, but in gross, and in
most details, the book is the result of experience,
and will be found reliable <i>as far as
<span class='pageno' title='6' id='Page_6'></span>it goes</i>. That it does not cover every possible
change and use to which the lathe can
be put, I am well aware.</p>

<p class='c006'>Something must be left for the workman
to find out himself. Neither have I given
any recipes for varnishes, for those cannot
be made by inexperienced persons. Moreover,
they can be had so cheaply and universally,
that it is mere folly for any amateur
to make them.</p>

<p class='c006'>Saluting all persons who love the art of
which this little volume is descriptive,</p>

<p class='c007'>I am their sincere friend,</p>

  <h2 id='chapter_i' class='c013'>CHAPTER I.</h2>
<h3 id='section_i_1' class='c014'>THE FOOT LATHE.</h3>

<p class='c015'>There are two distinct kinds of work done in
foot lathes—the useful and the merely ornamental.
Both afford enjoyment and profit to those who
practise them. The mechanic who earns his
living by working ten hours a day in a workshop,
does not care to go home and pursue the same
calling in the evening; but he can institute an
agreeable change in his life, beautify his dwelling,
and cultivate his taste, by the use of the lathe, and
thus obtain ornaments that would cost large sums
if purchased at the stores; or he may, indeed,
make the lathe a source of revenue, and sell the
product of his skill and ingenuity at high prices
to those who admire, but have not the ability to
construct.</p>

<p class='c006'>To many mechanics, even, the lathe is merely a
machine for turning cylinders or disks, or executing
<span class='pageno' title='14' id='Page_14'></span>beads, ogees, scrolls, or curves of various
radii, so that, after all, the work is pretty much
alike, and ceases to be attractive. This is quite a
mistaken view. There are no such goods in market
as those made on lathes, and peculiar tools
used in connection with them—by lathes with
traversing mandrels, with geometric chucks, with
dome chucks, and compound slide rests. There
are lathes that, while one could chase up a five-eight
bolt in them as well as on the simple pulley
and treadle machine, are also capable of executing
all sorts of beautiful things—vases with bases
nearly square, or exactly square, with round tops
and hexagonal bodies, with gracefully-curved angular
sides and bases, fluted vertically; boxes
with curious patterns, resembling basket work;
in fact, any combination of straight and curved
lines, cut in the sides, it is possible for an ingenious
man to invent. Strictly speaking, these are
not lathes, for in order to do the things before
mentioned it is necessary to use after attachments
in connection with them, so that the combination
of them produces the results spoken of. There is,
absolutely, an unlimited field for the genius of
workmen to exert itself in designing patterns and
executing work of an ornamental character.</p>

<p class='c006'>All ornamental work resolves itself into movements
of three kinds—angular, circular and
<span class='pageno' title='15' id='Page_15'></span>straight. From the combination of these with
each other, the times where they merge and
emerge, where a movement of one kind changes
into any other, where an ellipse becomes part of a
circle, where circles are generated across the circumferences
of other circles, where these patterns
are drawn over and upon each other without destroying
the character of either—we say, by such
movements, and many others which it would be
confusing to follow, the most beautiful forms are
made.</p>

<p class='c006'>Or, if the taste of the workman runs upon mechanical
instead of artistic things, there are steam
engines to be made, steam boilers to be spun up,
of small size; in fact, any piece or machine that
can be thought of.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is almost unnecessary to specify the innumerable
kinds of work that can be done in a hand
lathe, but the amateur who delights in metal turning
may make trinkets of all kinds for his friends,
that shall vie in beauty with the best efforts of
the jeweler and goldsmith. This, of course, is dependent
on the material used, the taste of the
workman, and his originality of conception. Pins
for ladies’ wear can be made of boxwood and
ebony, glued together in sections, of all designs,
and afterwards turned in beads and mouldings, or
otherwise ornamented in a chuck, as will be
<span class='pageno' title='16' id='Page_16'></span>shown hereafter. Sleeve buttons can be made of
ebony and silver, ivory and silver, pearl and gold,
or any combination that is desired. Chess and
checker men also afford a chance to display skill.
And, besides these, special work of any nature is
within the capacity of the machine.</p>

<p class='c006'>There is no family in this country that would
not find it economy to have a foot lathe in the
house, where the members have mechanical tastes—not
necessarily the male members, for ladies use
foot lathes, in Europe, with the greatest dexterity.
Some of the most beautiful work ever made, was
by Miss Holtzapfel, a relative of the celebrated
mechanist of the same name. If there are shovels
to be mended, the lathe will drill the holes and
turn the rivets. If the handle of the saucepan is
loose, it will do the same. If scissors or knives
want grinding, there is the lathe; if the castors on
the sofa break down, there is the lathe; if skates
need repairs, either of grinding or of any other
kind, there is the lathe. In short, it ought to be
as much a part of domestic economy as the sewing
machine, for it takes the odd stitches in the
mechanical department that save money.</p>

<p class='c006'>Let not the inexperienced reader, who hears of
a lathe for the first time, be frightened at this array
of terms, or diverted from the use of it by
the recital. In its simple form, as shown in <a href='#i015'>Fig. 1</a>,
<span class='pageno' title='17' id='Page_17'></span>it is readily understood, and, after a little practice,
easily managed by any one, and, after the first
few weeks, the amateur will realize the fruits of
his application.</p>

<div id='i015'  class='figcenter id005'>
<div class='ic005'>

<img src='images/i_015.jpg' alt='' class='ig005' />
</div>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' title='18' id='Page_18'></span>At first, it had not even a continuous rotary
motion, but the spindle was driven by a belt
worked by a spring pole or its equivalent. The
belt was rolled round the spindle, and the pole
allowed to spring up; the spindle then revolved
the length of the belt, or rope, for belts were not
thought of, and the operation was repeated, the
work being done only when the force of the spring
pole revolved the spindle and the job the right
way.</p>

<p class='c006'>Foot lathes had, prior to the introduction of
the engine lathe, been used on very heavy work.
It is but a few years, comparatively speaking—not
twenty—since cast-iron shafts, six, eight, and
ten inches in diameter, were turned in such lathes.
For all that we know to the contrary, many jobs,
far exceeding this in size, have been thus executed.</p>

<p class='c006'>In some shops, there are still standing heavy
oaken shears, made of timber twenty inches deep,
and four or six inches wide, faced with boiler
iron, and in the racks above there are long-shanked
tools, with which the men of old were
wont to do the work.</p>

<p class='c006'>These lathes are never used now, except for
drilling holes, or for apprentices to practice on,
but they serve to show what machinists had to do
in olden times, when there were no vise benches
<span class='pageno' title='19' id='Page_19'></span>to sit on and watch the chips curling off the tool,
as men do now.</p>

<div id='i017'  class='figcenter id006'>
<div class='ic006'>
<p>Fig. 2.</p>
</div>
<img src='images/i_017.jpg' alt='' class='ig006' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>Hand lathes are not in great favor in large machine
shops. They are not used, or should not be,
for any purpose except drilling, and then they are
no longer hand lathes, but horizontal drilling machines.
There is no simple work to be done on a
hand lathe that could not be performed to better
advantage and more cheaply on a machine constructed
for the purpose.</p>

<p class='c006'>Some large machine shops keep a hand lathe
going continually, cutting off stud bolts, facing
and rounding up nuts, and similar work. This
does not seem profitable. A machine to do this
work would do more, of a better quality, than
hand labor could.</p>

<p class='c006'>The foot lathe—the terms hand and foot lathe
are synonymous—is generally used, at the present
time, by small machinists, manufacturers of gas
fixtures, amateurs, etc.; men who do not work a
<span class='pageno' title='20' id='Page_20'></span>lathe constantly, but are called off to braze or
solder, or, perhaps, to fit some detail with a file.
For these uses the foot lathe is one of the cheapest
of tools; for the same person that does the work
furnishes the power also, so that a man working
on a foot, or hand lathe, as it is often called,
ought to have first-class wages. Moreover, a first-rate
foot lathe turner is always a good mechanic,
for it takes no small degree of dexterity to perform
the several jobs with ease, and dispatch, and
certainty. To always get hold of the right tool,
to use the same properly, so that it will last a
reasonable time without being ground or tempered,
to rough-turn hollow places with a square
edge, to chase a true thread to the right size every
time, without making a drunken one, or a slanting
one, to make a true thread inside of an oil
cup or a box—all these several tasks require good
judgment, dexterity, and a steady hand. Of
course, where a slide-rest is used, the case is different.
We allude, specially, to a cutting tool
managed by the hand.</p>

<p class='c006'>To do all these things, however, it is necessary
to have tools, and good ones, or none. It is an
old saying, that a bad workman quarrels with his
tools, but a good workman has a right to quarrel
with bad tools, if he is furnished with them,
through chance or design. It is impossible to execute
<span class='pageno' title='21' id='Page_21'></span>good work with a dull tool, one badly
shaped, or unsuited to the purpose, and, therefore,
it is important to set out right at the beginning.</p>

<p class='c006'>There is no tool more efficient in the hands of a
good workman, than the diamond point, <a href='#i017'>Fig. 2</a>,
here shown. For roughing off a piece of metal,
for squaring up the end, for facing a piece held in
the chuck, for running out a curve, or rounding
up a globe, it is equally well adapted. It may be
truly called the turner’s friend.</p>

<div class='chapter'></div>
<div>  <span class='pageno' title='22' id='Page_22'></span></div>
  <h2 id='chapter_ii' class='c004'>CHAPTER II.</h2>
<h3 id='section_ii_1' class='c014'>TOOLS.</h3>

<p class='c015'>Any one who has watched a novice at work on
a lathe, must have remarked the difficulty he has in
controlling the tool and keeping up the motion of
the treadle at the same time. The two operations
are difficult to “get the hang of,” to use a homely
phrase; but once conquered, the work can proceed.
The natural tendency is to slack up or stop the
motion of the treadle while the tool is engaged,
and the tool is, therefore, at one time under the
work, at another time above it, at another jumping
rankly in, until, finally, the piece goes whirling out
of the center or the chuck, and the operator flushes
all over at his awkwardness.</p>

<p class='c006'>This, of course, is remedied by practice; and as
this work is written mainly for the information of
beginners and amateurs, we hope that experts and
those who know all about hand lathes, will excuse
allusion to such simple things as holding the tool
properly, and kindred matters.</p>

<p class='c006'>The lathe must be of such a height as the workman
finds convenient, so that he is not obliged to
<span class='pageno' title='23' id='Page_23'></span>stoop much, and, at the same time, low enough to
allow the weight of the body to be thrown on the
tool when hard work is to be done. The speed of
the lathe ought to be very high on the smallest
cone, and there should be three speeds, at least,
for different work. The object is to regulate the
velocity of the work in the lathe, and keep the
motion of the treadle uniform, as near as may be,
at all times. It distresses a workman greatly,
when chasing a fine thread on a small diameter, if
he has to tread fast to get up the proper speed, as
he does when there are only two speeds. On the
contrary, for larger jobs, it is difficult to keep up
a rotary motion if the foot moves slowly, as it
must in order not to burn the tool by a high velocity
on some kinds of work. Foot lathes, in
general, are not geared, although some are, and
ought to have wider ranges of speed than they do.
Where one class of work is done, however, it
makes little difference, but for general turning,
the speeds should vary.</p>

<p class='c006'>Another difficulty experienced by beginners is
in holding the tool still—<em>rigidly so</em>. They allow
it to “bob” back and forth against the work, if it
runs untrue, so that it is impossible to make a job.
The tool must be held hard down, as if it grew to
the rest, and never moved, nor receded, until the
cut begun is finished.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' title='24' id='Page_24'></span>The “rest” should be of soft, wrought iron,
since that material holds a tool with more tenacity;
imposing less strain on the arms of the operator.
It should be dressed off smooth as often as
it gets badly worn, or cut by indentations. Cast
iron is not good, and steel is not so good as
wrought iron. A special rest should be kept for
chasing threads with, since the least obstacle is
enough, when running up a fine thread, to divert
the chaser and spoil the job, by making a drunken
thread. If we now suppose the lathe to be in
good order, the centers true and well-turned to a
gauge, the rod (if that is the job) between them and
properly “dogged,” the centers oiled, and the
rest at the right height, we shall be all ready to
start. The rest should be high enough to bring
the point of the tool a little above the center.</p>

<div class='ic007'>
<p>Fig. 3.</p>
</div>
<img src='images/i_022.jpg' alt='' class='ig007' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>To rough off the outside, and make it run true,
is the first step, and the tool must, therefore, be
held as in <a href='#i022'>Fig. 3</a>, or so that the point and part of
the edge alone engage with the work. This will
<span class='pageno' title='25' id='Page_25'></span>take off a thin, spiral cut, without springing the
shaft or making it untrue. The whole surface of
the shaft must be thus run over, beginning at the
right hand and shifting the tool as fast as one part
is turned. The tool should not be moved rigidly
in a straight line toward the belt, but by holding
it hard down on the rest, so that the bottom edge
bears as in <a href='#i017'>Fig. 2</a>, and rocking the tool on that
angle, so that the point describes a curve, as in
<a href='#i023'>Fig. 4</a>, the work will be turned evenly and true.</p>

<div id='i023'  class='figcenter id008'>
<div class='ic008'>
<p>Fig. 4.</p>
</div>
<img src='images/i_023.jpg' alt='' class='ig008' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>We must remark, in passing, that the person
who reads these directions, and then undertakes to
turn by them, will find that reading how to do a
thing, and doing it, are two different matters.</p>

<p class='c006'>It looks very nice to see a skater darting over
the ice at his ease, but try it once, and, if you
never knew before, you will understand what experience
means. Trying to teach a person to be a
turner, in a book, is analogous. One can only indicate
the general method, and leave experience to
do the rest.</p>

<div id='i024a'  class='figcenter id009'>
<div class='ic009'>
<p>Fig. 5.</p>
</div>
<span class='pageno' title='26' id='Page_26'></span>
<img src='images/i_024a.jpg' alt='' class='ig009' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>After the whole surface has been run over, the
same tool may be used on the flat side for reducing
the work to one diameter throughout the
length. The reader must not assume that there
is no other tool than a diamond point; he will
find many others adverted to, as we proceed.</p>

<div id='i024b'  class='figcenter id010'>
<div class='ic010'>
<p>Fig. 6.</p>
</div>
<img src='images/i_024b.jpg' alt='' class='ig010' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>It is most important that the ends of a rod or
shaft should be squared up first, before the body
is turned, for the removal of some slight inequality
subsequently may cause the whole shaft to run
out of truth. The center must be drilled with a
<span class='pageno' title='27' id='Page_27'></span>small drill, and slightly countersunk.
When the end is squared
up, the center must be run back
a little, so that the tool point
may project over the drilled
hole, and thus make it all true
about the center, as in <a href='#i024a'>Fig. 5</a>.
This will make the work push
over to one side of the center,
but that is of no consequence.
Let it run as it will; so long as
it does not come out of the centers
there need be no apprehension.</p>

<p class='c006'><a href='#i024b'>Fig. 6</a>, is another kind of
roughing tool, to do heavier
work with.</p>

<div id='i025'  class='figcenter id011'>
<div class='ic011'>
<p>Fig. 7.</p>
</div>
<img src='images/i_025.jpg' alt='' class='ig011' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>There are two kinds of tools
used in foot lathes, called
straight and heel tools. <a href='#i025'>Fig. 7</a>
is a heel tool. It is so called
from the heel which is forged on
the lower end. One form of the
straight tool has already been
shown. The heel tool is used on heavy work,
and the object of it is apparent, namely, to hold
on the rest, and so impose but little labor on the
workman to retain it in place, or prevent it from
<span class='pageno' title='28' id='Page_28'></span>receding. It is generally forged from half inch
or five eighth steel. The steel is held in a handle
twenty inches long, grooved on top to fit the steel,
and furnished with a handle at right angles. This
handle has a square eye in the top that the tool
passes through. A nut at the end of it screws up
the eye and binds the tool fast in the groove, so
that it cannot slip.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is given complete in <a href='#i025'>Fig. 7</a>. The lower handle
enables the workman to have great power
over the edge, and to direct it from or to the
<span class='pageno' title='29' id='Page_29'></span>work without danger of catching. The tool is
used by resting the end on the shoulder, as in Fig.
8, and turning the lowest handle. Since the heel
holds the tool from slipping, there is no occasion
to bear against it. In fact, there is no occasion, at
any time, to force the tool from the workman, but
it must be turned sideways, back and forth. A
piece, properly centered, may be cut in any way
without destroying its truth.</p>

  <h2 id='chapter_iii' class='c004'>CHAPTER III.</h2>
<h3 id='section_iii_1' class='c014'>SCRAPERS, ETC.</h3>

<p class='c015'>To suit different kinds of work, as previously
stated, various tools are needed, but the reader
must not expect to see them all illustrated in this
book. The workman will learn what tools he
needs, and make them for himself, which will be
of more advantage to him than engravings could
be. The tools here shown, will be found very
useful in different places.</p>

<div id='i028'  class='figleft id013'>
<div class='ic013'>
<p>Fig. 9.</p>
</div>
<img src='images/i_028.jpg' alt='' class='ig013' />
</div>

<p class='c006'><a href='#i028'>Fig. 9</a> is the end of a thin-edged, flat
scraper, and is chiefly to be used on
brass work. It may be of any length
and size, but for small lathes, and light
work, it is cheaper and handier to make
it of thin sheet steel, one eighth or one
tenth of an inch thick, and to form the
reverse end into a round nose, or half-circle
scraper.</p>

<div id='i029a'  class='figright id014'>
<div class='ic014'>
<p>Fig. 10.</p>
</div>
<img src='images/i_029a.jpg' alt='' class='ig014' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>It often happens that fillets or hollows occur, as
in finishing ornamental brass work, in connection
with flat surfaces. By having such a tool as this,
the necessity of laying one tool down and picking
<span class='pageno' title='31' id='Page_31'></span>up another, is obviated, for the two are combined
in one. For iron work, it is customary to use a
heavier and thicker tool for finishing. As in Fig.
10, the front edge is
slightly raised or concave,
to make it sharp
and hold a cut well. All
turning tools for finishing
iron are made thicker
than those for brass,
and should have lips, or curved cutting edges.
Such tools cannot be used for brass, as they are
too sharp; the edges jump into the metal and
spoil the work.</p>

<p class='c006'>A tool for scraping brass work of some kinds is
made as shown in Figs. 11 and 12.</p>

<div id='i029b'  class='figcenter id015'>
<div class='ic015'>
<p>Fig. 11.</p>
</div>
<img src='images/i_029b.jpg' alt='' class='ig015' />
</div>

<div id='i029c'  class='figcenter id016'>
<div class='ic016'>
<p>Fig. 12.</p>
</div>
<img src='images/i_029c.jpg' alt='' class='ig016' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>There is no occasion to make the ends at different
angles, except the convenience, before
stated, of having four cutting edges on one piece,
for any angle can be easily given by the position
<span class='pageno' title='32' id='Page_32'></span>of the hand or the direction of the rest. These
tools, here alluded to, are only to be used when the
job has been all turned true and the scale removed;
they <em>scrape</em>, merely, they do not cut.</p>

<p class='c006'>Such tools sometimes save a few steps at a critical
period; that is, when the tool is well set and in place,
so that the work is done better and more expeditiously.
Apart from this consideration, there
is the chance of cutting or injuring the hands, by
the proximity of sharp edges. Under the control
of an expert, however, there is little danger from
this cause, as inspection will show. Skilful men
that have worked a lifetime at their trade, have
few marks or scars on their hands, as a general
thing.</p>

<p class='c006'>When these scrapers are used on cast iron, or,
indeed, on brass of a peculiar composition, they
sometimes “chatter,” as it is called, and leave the
work full of deep, unsightly marks, like those on
the edge of coins. The cause of chattering is the
rapid vibration of the tool, so that it springs away
from, and against the work, with great rapidity,
leaving traces of its edge on the work. Chattering
may be prevented, by putting a piece of sole
leather on the rest, between it and the tool.</p>

<p class='c006'>The tools with long handles are chiefly intended
for heavy work, or that which requires both
hands to the cut, but there are smaller tools than
<span class='pageno' title='33' id='Page_33'></span>these, used by amateurs, wherein the common
file handle, or one like it, only a little longer, is
employed instead.</p>

<h3 id='section_iii_2' class='c016'>CHASING AND SCREW CUTTING.</h3>

<p class='c015'>In an engine, or power lathe, all screws are cut
by trains of gears, as mechanics well know, but
in the hand lathe, which was the first machine,
screws, both male and female, must be made by
chasers or hubs, both inside and outside. The
chaser itself must be made first, however, and
that is done by a simple tool called “a hub.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The chaser is first forged in blank, for an outside
chaser, as in <a href='#i031b'>Fig. 14</a>, and as in <a href='#i031c'>Fig. 15</a> for an
<span class='pageno' title='34' id='Page_34'></span>inside tool. It is then filed up, and held against
a hub, shown in <a href='#i031a'>Fig. 13</a>, running in the lathe.
This rapidly cuts away the chaser blank, and
forms the teeth in it perfectly. The lines across
it are spiral grooves, cut completely round from
one side to the other, so that the hub cuts the
blank like any other tool. <a href='#i032'>Fig. 16</a> represents

<h3 id='section_iv_1' class='c014'>CHASERS, ETC.</h3>

<p class='c015'>It is not always an easy task to chase a true
thread on a piece of work, and even “the boldest
holds his breath for a time,” if he has a nice piece
of work all done but the thread, and that in a
critical part. It is so easy to make a drunken
thread, or one in which the spirals are not true,
but diverge or waver in their path around the
shaft, that many are made. That they are more
common than true threads, is well known to mechanics.
To start a thread true is quite easy with
an inside chaser; for, strange as it may seem, it is
seldom that a drunken thread is made on inside
work; only have the bore itself true, and the
chaser will run in properly. The case is different
when a bolt or shaft is to be cut. With fine
threads, the slightest obstruction on the rest will
cause the chaser to catch and stop slightly. No
matter how slight the stoppage, it is certain to
damage the thread. The injury is more perceptible
on fine threads than on coarse, for, in the
former, if the threads do not fit (as they will not
<span class='pageno' title='36' id='Page_36'></span>if they are drunken, one crossing the other, when
both parts are put together), the drunken thread
will not come fair with the other. In coarse
threads, however, it will not be so apparent, for,
by making the drunken thread smaller, it will
have play and accommodate itself to its place. This
is not workmanship, it is “make-shift.”</p>

<p class='c006'>To chase a true thread the rest must be smooth
and free from burrs or depressions. Nice workmen
keep a special rest, with a hard, polished
steel edge, expressly for this purpose.</p>

<p class='c006'>If the chasers themselves are smoothly finished
at the bottom, on an emery wheel, they are all
the better. With these precautions, and others
noted below, success is certain. When a thread
is to be started, take a fine diamond-pointed tool,
and hold it on the end of the shaft to be chased.
Set the lathe going, and give the tool a quick
twist with the wrist, so that a spiral will be traced
on the work, like <a href='#i034'>Fig. 17</a>.</p>

<div id='i034'  class='figcenter id021'>
<div class='ic021'>
<p>Fig. 17.</p>
</div>
<img src='images/i_034.jpg' alt='' class='ig021' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>Some part of this will correspond with the
pitch of the thread to be cut, and there is less
liability of making it drunken. By a little practice,
<span class='pageno' title='37' id='Page_37'></span>one is able to hit the pitch of the chaser exactly
in making a start.</p>

<p class='c006'>“There is no trouble, after you once know
how.” We have chased quantities of small
screws, with forty-eight threads to the inch, and
not a sixteenth of one inch in diameter. If the
chaser once hesitates on such screws, they are
spoiled. For heavy threads—seven and eight to
the inch, which is about as hard work as any one
wants to do,—it is the custom of some turners to
use a tool with only two teeth, and some use only
a sharp-edged cutter, like <a href='#i035'>Fig. 18</a>, to deepen the
thread, the chaser being used afterward, to rectify
the job. There is danger with this tool, unless
it is used by an expert, of digging out the thread,
so that the last end of it will be worse than the
first.</p>

<div id='i035'  class='figcenter id022'>
<div class='ic022'>
<p>Fig. 18.</p>
</div>
<img src='images/i_035.jpg' alt='' class='ig022' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>Another tool, used in chasing heavy threads, is
a doctor. This consists in having a fac-simile of
the thread to be cut on the back of the chaser,
and in applying a short set screw behind, so that,
<span class='pageno' title='38' id='Page_38'></span>as the iron is cut away, the chaser may be followed
up behind. <a href='#i036'>Fig. 19</a> is the doctor, but the
follower opposite the chaser is too narrow, and
should be made nearly half a circle to avoid slipping;
with this exception it is all right.</p>

<p class='c006'>These tools, and the screws made by them, are
all inferior to those made by lathes with traversing
mandrels; that is, a mandrel which slides
in and out of the head stock, as in a Holtzapffel
lathe.</p>

<div id='i036'  class='figcenter id023'>
<div class='ic023'>
<p>Fig. 19.</p>
</div>
<img src='images/i_036.jpg' alt='' class='ig023' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>This lathe has a series of hubs, unlike the one
shown previously, slipped over the back end of the
lathe spindle (furthest from the workman) and a
fixed nut on the head-stock, which, being put in
<span class='pageno' title='39' id='Page_39'></span>communication with the hub on the mandrel,
drives the same in and out, according to the direction
the cone-pulleys are turned. Of course, with
such an attachment as this, there is no danger of
making drunken threads, for the hubs which
start the threads, are cut with a train of gears in
an engine lathe, so that it is impossible for them
to be incorrect. Moreover, a square thread, or a
V-shaped thread, can be made with them, which
is not the case with common chasers.</p>

<p class='c006'>In lathes that have traversing mandrels to cut
screws, the tool itself remains stationary, but as
this is obviously a disadvantage in many kinds of
work, it is far better to have the tool advance and
the mandrel revolve as usual. By this plan much
time is saved, a greater range of work is possible
with the same gear, and a piece that is chucked,
or one that is between the centers, can be cut with
equal facility.</p>

<p class='c006'>Any common lathe can be rigged to do this by
putting a shell on the back end of the mandrel,
between the pulley and the set screw, and slipping
the hub over the shell, with a feather, to keep it
from turning. To take a thread from this hub,
a round bar must be set parallel with the shears,
in easy-working guides. The bar must have an
arm at one end, to reach over to the hub, said arm
to be fitted with a piece of hard wood, to match
<span class='pageno' title='40' id='Page_40'></span>the thread on the hub. The other end of the bar
has the cutting tool in it; of course, at right angles,
so as to run in to the work, and bear on the
tool rest. The tool is held in an arm on the bar
by a set screw, so that it can be lengthened or
shortened.</p>

<p class='c006'>By this arrangement, a true thread can be
rapidly generated on any rod, hollow cylinder, or
other kind of work—the pitch depending on the
pitch of the hub.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is necessary to have as many different hubs,
varying in pitch, as there are different kinds of
work to be done, and, although the thread on the
hub is only an inch or half an inch long, perhaps,
a screw of any length may be cut on a rod, by
simply shifting the cutter on the rest. This same
bar is also useful for turning, as with a slide rest,
for, by sliding it along gradually, it acts, in a
measure, like a fixed tool in a slide rest.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>From these hints the
amateur who takes a lathe
in hand for the first time,
or is, at best, a neophyte,
may learn much to his
advantage. Persons of a
mechanical turn only need
a hint, when the mind springs to the conclusion
with surprising rapidity.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' title='41' id='Page_41'></span>The little tool, shown in <a href='#i038'>Fig. 20</a>, is very handy
in many instances, particularly for running under
the necks of screws when the thread is cut up to
the head. By so making them, the head comes
fair down upon its bed, and holds much better.</p>

</div>

<p class='c015'>Chucking work in the lathe is one of the most
interesting branches, for here there are no centers
in the way, to plague the workman, and the tool
has a fair sweep at all parts. Every one who uses a
lathe, should get a scroll chuck, <a href='#i040'>Fig. 21</a>, of Cushman’s
make, (A. Cushman, Hartford, Connecticut,)
that is, a chuck where the jaws move up together
toward the center, so that any round piece will be
held perfectly true. This is a great convenience,
<span class='pageno' title='43' id='Page_43'></span>for whether we have a ring to bore out, or a
wheel to turn off, it is equally handy, and is far
better than the independent jaw chuck, which has
to be set up by measurement,
and repeated
trials before it is
right. To those who
cannot afford to purchase
a scroll chuck,
a wooden one can be
made to answer every
purpose. Wooden
chucks should be made
of some hard, fine-grained wood, such as maple or
mahogany, so that they will hold well whatever
is driven into them.</p>

<div class='inlinecontainer'>
<div id='i041b'  class='figinline id027'>

<p class='c006'>If we have a small cylinder head to turn, for
instance, the back head, which has no hole in it
to put a mandrel through, as the front one has,
<span class='pageno' title='44' id='Page_44'></span>the wooden chuck will come in play. To make
one, the turner takes a square block of the proper
thickness, say one inch, and saws the corners off,
so that it is eight-sided. It is then ready to screw
on the face plate of the lathe. This is quickly
done by having small screw holes in the plate for
this purpose, as shown in <a href='#i015'>Fig. 1</a>, page 17.</p>

<div id='i042a'  class='figcenter id029'>
<div class='ic029'>
<p>Fig. 25.</p>
</div>
<img src='images/i_042a.jpg' alt='' class='ig029' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>The block is then all ready
to work on, and the face must
be turned off true, and a recess
cut out in it to receive the head.
This is the head, <a href='#i042b'>Fig. 26</a>.</p>

<div id='i042b'  class='figleft id030'>
<div class='ic030'>
<p>Fig. 26.</p>
</div>
<img src='images/i_042b.jpg' alt='' class='ig030' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>On the back side, there is a
projection to fit the cylinder of
the engine. This must be turned first, and the
flange faced off true: after that the head must be
pryed out, (by making a little recess in the chuck,
<span class='pageno' title='45' id='Page_45'></span>alongside of it,) reversed, and put in the chuck again,
the finished side in, so as to polish it on the outside.
<a href='#i043'>Fig. 27</a>. It must be driven up tight against
the face of the chuck, otherwise the flange will be
thicker on one side than the other. In finishing,
it will be found better to commence near the center,
and work out toward the largest diameter, for
it is necessary to get under the scale, or sand, left
on in casting, first, before the work can be turned
true, and this is easiest done by beginning at the
middle, where the speed is low. The scale is
fused sand melted on the metal in the act of casting.
The best tool to do this with is the diamond-point,
for it can be employed universally on
straight or hollow surfaces, is easily ground, and
always works well. After it, comes the scraper,
previously shown. If these chatter, a piece of
leather must be put between them and the rest.
It is also well to put a stout iron rod, or piece of
<span class='pageno' title='46' id='Page_46'></span>hard wood, between the back center of the lathe
and the face of the plate; this keeps everything
steady, as shown below, so that a beautiful luster
will be given by the tool alone.</p>

<div id='i043'  class='figcenter id031'>
<div class='ic031'>
<p>Fig. 27.</p>
</div>
<img src='images/i_043.jpg' alt='' class='ig031' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>After the plate or head is firmly scraped, it
must be polished with flour emery and oil. The
emery first used must be No. 1, which is about
like Indian meal; if the work is brass, however,
this will not be needed. This must be plentifully
supplied with oil, so that it is like cream, and the
workman, taking a soft pine stick, with the end
pounded into a brush, so that it will hold emery,
holds it hard up against the face of the head. If
it has been properly scraped, a few revolutions
will produce a fine-grained finish, but if it is badly
done, the corners will be full of scratches and
chatters. It takes time and experience to make a
good finisher, and patience also, for men who are
good turners, and can make excellent fits, are
sometimes botches at polishing.</p>

<p class='c006'>After emery of the finest possible description
has been used, a little rouge powder should be
put on a piece of buckskin and applied to the
work. This will make a polish equal to gold on
brass, and like silver on iron. Instead of these
methods many persons burnish their work. The
burnisher is sometimes made of steel, of bloodstone,
and of agate. Steel is the material generally
<span class='pageno' title='47' id='Page_47'></span>employed. It is polished as bright as can be
on a buff wheel, and must be preserved so, otherwise
it is useless to attempt doing anything with
it. Pumice stone is very good for polishing with,
or rather for finishing the surface before polishing.
Other substances will be mentioned hereafter.
Steel and iron are best polished with a sharp tool
and water. To turn steel with a handsome surface,
the tool must be sharpened on an oil stone,
and the speed high, then spit on the work and
take light cuts, and you will have a nice job. To
make a very brilliant polish on steel, it is necessary
to use emery and oil, plenty of oil and not
much emery, but this makes such a nasty mess on
the lathe, that few good turners will do it. A file
should not be used in the lathe if possible; filing
a job makes it uneven, and spoils the looks of it.
It is difficult to avoid scratches, and the expert
can generally tell the difference between work
that has been turned true, and that which has been
filed, and, in nearly all cases, it is quicker to turn
the work to fit or to finish at once.</p>

<p class='c006'>In polishing round work, such as rods or shafts,
it is much cleaner, and more expeditious, to make
a pair of clamps like <a href='#i046'>Fig. 28</a>, and put the emery
and oil on leather pads between them. The clamps
consist of two straight pieces of soft or hard wood,
lined with leather, though some use sheet lead.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' title='48' id='Page_48'></span>The leather catches the polishing material and
holds it, and, at the same time, keeps it continually
applied to the shaft. The clamps are slipped over
the same, and the ends held in the hand. This
utensil also gives a fine finish to the work, making
it smooth and even. It must be carried regularly
along from end to end, sometimes fast and sometimes
slow, so as to cross the lines, or avoid making
a twist in the polish like a screw thread,
which would otherwise be given. A very beautiful
and brilliant luster can be given to a shaft of
iron or steel, after it is nicely finished, by holding
a sheet of fine <em>sand paper</em>, covered with chalk,
on it. The glaze that this gives, makes the work
glisten like silver, but it also takes off all the
grease, so that the shaft is very sensitive to
moisture, and is quickly rusted.</p>

<p class='c006'>This discussion about polishing has led us
away from the consideration of chucking, which
we shall enlarge a little more upon.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' title='49' id='Page_49'></span>The chuck is a very necessary and even indispensable
auxiliary when chasing. Threads cannot
be caught in the jaws of a scroll chuck, because,
if set tight enough to hold the work, the
threads are jammed so that they will not run in
the part they were fitted to. If a piece, having a
thread cut on it, like <a href='#i047'>Fig. 29</a>, is to be turned outside,
it is very easy to chase the
cap first and then the cup it fits,
so that the cap can be screwed
into it and turned off where it
belongs; it will then be true,
and is easy to mill on the edge.</p>

<div id='i047'  class='figright id033'>
<div class='ic033'>
<p>Fig. 29.</p>
</div>
<img src='images/i_047.jpg' alt='' class='ig033' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>It must always be borne in
mind that the chaser must be sharp. If it is not,
drunken threads will be the rule, not the exception.</p>

<p class='c006'>The chuck shown in <a href='#i048'>Fig. 30</a>, will be found
very useful for holding metallic disks, small
box covers, or anything that requires merely a
slight clasp; it is also useful for holding round
plugs, pencils of wood, or penholders, to drill in
the ends. It can be made eccentric with the
mandrel of the lathe, if desired, so as to turn a
piece on one side, or drill in a similar manner in
the end of a plug. It is merely a piece of boxwood
bored out, bored with holes, which are
sawed down into slots, so as to form a series of
<span class='pageno' title='50' id='Page_50'></span>jaws, which are sprung in by sliding the ring
down on them. They are so easily made that a
great many can be provided.</p>

<h3 id='section_vi_1' class='c014'>METAL SPINNING.</h3>

<p class='c015'>Spinning sheet metal into various forms is
another kind of work which can be done in the
foot lathe, and it is here that the amateur can
show his taste and dexterity.</p>

<p class='c006'>The process consists in forming a blank, like
this engraving, into an ornamental
base for a lamp, or an oil cup;
in fact, any thing whatsoever.
All that is requisite is to have a
fac simile, in wood, of the shape
you wish to make. This is bolted
or otherwise made fast to the
face plate, and the blank is then set up against it,
and held as the cylinder head, shown in <a href='#i042b'>Fig. 26</a>,
is, that is, with a rod leading from the back center
of the lathe to the work.</p>

<div id='i049'  class='figright id035'>
<div class='ic035'>
<p>Fig. 31.</p>
</div>
<img src='images/i_049.jpg' alt='' class='ig035' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>A tool like <a href='#i050a'>Fig. 32</a> is then used to press the
metal into all the recesses or curves of the pattern.
The speed must be high, and the metal
quite soft and moistened with a little soap-suds or
oil, so that it will not be scratched by the tool.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' title='52' id='Page_52'></span>To spin metal requires some dexterity, but it is
easily acquired after a little practice. The rest
must be furnished with holes, like <a href='#i050b'>Fig. 33</a>, and a
pin, so that the tool can be brought up against it
like a lever.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Still-another kind of metal spinning can be
done in the lathe. This relates to making circular
shapes, or cylindrical, more properly—such as
napkin rings, the tops of steam pipes, or similar
things. To do this, a mandrel is requisite. The
mandrel must be of steel, and turned to the desired
pattern—like <a href='#i050c'>Fig. 34</a>, for instance.</p>

<div id='i050c'  class='figcenter id038'>

<p>Fig. 34.</p>
</div>
<img src='images/i_050c.jpg' alt='' class='ig038' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>A ferrule is then made and soldered together
<span class='pageno' title='53' id='Page_53'></span>with lapped edges, so that there will be no seam.
The mandrel must be as much smaller than the
size of the finished work as will allow it to come
off freely, for it will be apparent that if the work
was spun up <em>on</em> the mandrel, it could never be
taken off. The ferrule, when put on them, will
stand eccentric to the mandrel, as
in this figure—that is, when the
tool bears on it. In other respects
the process is just the
same as spinning on the face
plate. Tripoli, chalk, whiting,
rotten-stone, and similar substances
are used to give the fine polish on such
work.</p>

<p class='c006'>We know of no prettier or more expeditious
process of making a small steam boiler for a toy
engine, than by spinning it upon the lathe. The
boiler will be very strong, have large fire surface,
and be without joints, having only one at the bottom,
where it is easily kept tight. <a href='#i052'>Fig. 36</a> is the
boiler.</p>

<p class='c006'>The metal must be thin (twenty gauge), the
sheet brass sold in the shops will answer, as it is
already annealed, and the corrugations must not
be too deep on the sides, or the work will not
come off the mould. The center of the fire-box,
A, must be left flat, so that the flue will have a
<span class='pageno' title='54' id='Page_54'></span>bearing on it. For a small engine, 1-inch bore,
and 2-inch stroke, a boiler of the dimensions
given here is ample. The flue must be brazed or
soldered at A, and the bottom must be riveted at
B, for every two inches; this is not necessary,
however. There are only three pieces in this
boiler—the shell, the fire-box, and the flue, and
the water must not be carried more than three-fourths
of an inch over the crown of the furnace.</p>

<p class='c006'>Probably many of our readers, who use hand
lathes not furnished with slide rests, have wished
for that indispensable appendage where boring is
to be done. For ordinary turning, we do not appreciate
a slide rest on a hand lathe so much as
<span class='pageno' title='55' id='Page_55'></span>many do that we know, but for boring out valves,
cocks, or, in fact, anything, a scroll chuck and a
good slide rest are invaluable.</p>

<p class='c006'>Some persons are always “meaning” to do a
thing, yet never do it. Sometimes, for the want
of facilities, at others for the lack of an idea. If
the latter be of any value, we can furnish one or
two on this subject that may be useful.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>One way to bore out holes parallel, without a
slide rest, is to do it with the spindle of the back
head. With a tool of peculiar construction, holes
varying in size, can be bored beautifully in this
way. We present a view of such a tool in Fig.
37. It is merely a cross, formed on the end of a
center fitting the back spindle, the same as the
lathe center does. The arms of the cross are
made stout and thick, so as to admit of a square
hole being cut in them. The hole is made by
<span class='pageno' title='56' id='Page_56'></span>drilling in and driving in a square drift afterwards
to take off the corners. The shanks of the tools
are well fitted to these holes in the arms, so that
a slight pressure of the screws in the sides of the
arm will hold them steady. When used, the tool
is put in the back spindle, and the cutters set to
the size required, or less, if there is much to take
out, and run through the work in an obvious manner.
Any range of size can be had up to the diameter
of the cross. It is not well to run the
cutters out too far, however, as they will jump and
chatter, or spring, and make bad work. The tool
is so easily made that one can afford to have three
or four, for different jobs.</p>

</div>
<img src='images/i_054.jpg' alt='' class='ig042' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>Another plan, but not so good, is to make a
common center and disk, like <a href='#i054'>Fig. 38</a>.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' title='57' id='Page_57'></span>Here the cutters have a slot in them, through
which a bolt passes and screws into the disk; a
small piece of wood put at the bottom of the tool,
between it and the cutter, prevents it from slacking
off so as to diminish the cut. These tools will
be found useful, and will do good work if properly
handled. This latter tool is better for wood,
but will answer for any metal by varying the
cutter.</p>

<p class='c006'>To make a slide rest, in the common way, is a
costly and tedious job. For all purposes of boring,
a good one may be made as shown in the following
engraving, <a href='#i055'>Fig. 39</a>.</p>

<p class='c006'>This is simply a casting fitted with a screw and
spindle, as shown. The spindle has a tool let in
the front end and held there by a set screw, and
there is a wheel at the back end to run the spindle
in and out. The casting has a leg to it which
<span class='pageno' title='58' id='Page_58'></span>enables it to fit the common post the rest for the
hand tool fits. There is also a key to prevent the
spindle from turning round. By this arrangement
it is easy to bore, not only parallel holes of
any size, but tapering ones, which is often a
great convenience. By a simple change of tool,
it can also face off any casting, and can easily be
made to cut a thread, of a given pitch, by any ingenious
workman. Not only this, but it can also
be made without planing; or other work most
amateurs have no facilities for. It is within the
range of ordinary lathe work, and will be found
indispensable. The T-head may be of cast iron,
but the spindle should be steel, with a brass nut
let in the back end for the screw to work in.</p>

<p class='c006'>Go to any dealer in box-wood, and procure
<span class='pageno' title='60' id='Page_60'></span>waste stuff, which he will sell at a small price.
Take a piece an inch square, put it in the chuck,
and turn it round on one end as far as you can,
then reverse it, and turn the other end; this will
make a round plug. Take a ten-cent piece, and
chuck it, either in a wooden or scroll chuck. Cut
out the center, so that you have a silver ring. It
will be necessary to have two rings, one for each
button. Put the box-wood in the lathe and turn
the end as in <a href='#i058b'>Fig. 41</a>. On the shoulder you are to
shrink the silver ring just made, <a href='#i058a'>Fig. 40</a>. To
fasten the ring properly, you
have only to leave the center
part of the box-wood a little
larger than the silver ring—say
the thickness of a sheet of paper—heat
the ring slightly on a
stove or over a spirit lamp, and
clap it on to its place. When it is cool, if properly
done, no power can remove it without destroying
the button. When the ring is in place, it
<span class='pageno' title='61' id='Page_61'></span>only remains to turn it off as ornamentally as the
workman desires. The edge may be milled, and
the face chased or left smooth. The center of the
button, which is of wood, may be drilled in, and
<span class='pageno' title='62' id='Page_62'></span>a square ebony plug put in, which will give it a
unique appearance, as shown in <a href='#i058c'>Fig. 42</a>. In like
manner ivory buttons may be turned and breastpins
spun up, either in gold or silver. Brass
breastpins may be ornately turned, and afterwards
electro-plated for a trifle. They will thus be
cheaply made, and the ingenious turner can please
his lady friends by presenting them with specimens
of his dexterity and taste.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>At the commencement of this book, I alluded
to lathes with traversing mandrels, and to varieties
of work done by tools not generally employed—that
is, those which are not used by the hand, but
in connection with the lathe, and driven by belting
from a counter shaft over head. I give an
illustration of such a tool, in one form, in <a href='#i059'>Fig. 43</a>.
It may be screwed in the tool post of the slide
rest, or otherwise attached to the lathe,
and the belt from
the counter shaft
carried over the
small pulley. The
driving pulley over
head should be very large, so as to give a great
velocity to the cutter, at least fifteen hundred
revolutions per minute. The use of this tool is to
make ornamental designs—circular carving, it
<span class='pageno' title='63' id='Page_63'></span>might be called—on all kinds of turned work, as,
for instance, in <a href='#i060'>Fig. 44</a>, where a small box for
pins or needles is shown. This box is made by
putting a piece of hard, fine-grained wood in the
chuck, boring the hole and cutting the thread. It
is then removed, driven on a round mandrel held
in the chuck, turned off round outside, and then
prepared for the pattern as follows:—The design
settled upon, the index plate must be brought into
use, and the points inserted in such holes as will
bring the pattern out right, or all the spaces equal—just
as the teeth of gears are cut. The tool
shown in <a href='#i059'>Fig. 43</a>, may be any desired shape. In
the example of work, <a href='#i060'>Fig. 44</a>, it is made half
round, and the pattern is called “bamboo,” from
a resemblance to wickerwork. The pattern is
made to break joint, as mechanics say, that is, it
alternates, so that the commencement of one part
meets in the middle of the other. After one
course is made all the way round, the tool is
shifted on to another course, and the index
changed as above mentioned, until the whole has
been gone over. This produces a beautiful effect.</p>

<div id='i060'  class='figleft id048'>
<div class='ic048'>
<p>Fig. 44.</p>
</div>
<img src='images/i_060.jpg' alt='' class='ig048' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>It is easy to see that a change of pattern is produced
at will, by altering the kind of tool and
the index. As, for instance, in <a href='#i062'>Fig. 45</a>, where
the pattern is entirely straight. When the design
is to be cut on such work, it is extremely
convenient to have a pair of centers to set on the
<span class='pageno' title='64' id='Page_64'></span>lathe, across the bed; then the flying tool is not
needed, nor the index on the lathe pulleys either,
that on the centers being used instead. When
this box is held between the centers so as not to
mar it, the handle may be turned and the work
run along under the cutter, with great facility.
The grooves shown in the box are first drilled at
each end with a common drill, just to the corner
of the drill, so that a neat and handsome finish is
given; a V-shaped cutter is then put in a mandrel
between the centers of the lathe, and the pulleys
set going, so that when the work is run under
the tool, the slot or groove will be formed. The
circlet, at the top of the box, is made by a crescent
drill ground very thin and made sharp—a drill
like a fish’s tail, only formed on a half circle.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>Of course, these methods of doing this kind of work
can, as I have said before, be varied infinitely, and
are only cited as applicable to a common foot lathe.</p>

<h3 id='section_viii_1' class='c014'>CENTERS.</h3>

<p class='c015'>An indispensable article on a foot lathe, where
any fancy work is to be done, is the centers—of
which I have before spoken—shown in <a href='#i064'>Fig. 46</a>.
These consist of a common set of heads, with
spindles fitted to them. One spindle has an index
plate and spring, and the other has a common
center. These heads set on a slide that is moved
back and forth over a rest, screwed to the lathe
bed as usual. It is easy to see that, with this, we
can do some very fine cabinet work. Suppose we
have a round vase turned up handsomely, and
wish to flute the base or make it a series of curves
all round; to do this, we have only to put it in
the centers, set the index so as to come out even,
as before explained, and go ahead.</p>

<div id='i064'  class='figcenter id050'>
<div class='ic050'>
<p>Fig. 46.</p>
</div>
<img src='images/i_064.jpg' alt='' class='ig050' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>The kind of cutter to be used is a sort of gouge,
set in a cast-iron head, something as a plane iron
is set in its stock. That is, fitted tight to a groove
and held by a set screw. Two of these cutters
should be used, at equal distances apart, and the
cutter head should be keyed on a short shaft, set
<span class='pageno' title='66' id='Page_66'></span>between the main centers of the lathe. The
whole should be accurately balanced, or else the
work will be full of chatters or ridges. Since
centrifugal force increases as the square of the
<span class='pageno' title='67' id='Page_67'></span>velocity, any thing that runs a little out of truth,
will be very much exaggerated as the speed increases.
By using cutters of different shapes,
beautiful effects can be produced; as, for instance,
suppose we take a common round-nose cutter, set
the index so as to divide the circle of the job we
are to work on in twenty-four parts, and execute
that part of the design, then take a tool forming
an ogee, and work out the spaces intervening, we
shall find that the article, when completed, will
have a beautiful appearance, and that, instead of
being round, the bottom will be octagonal, which
will present a pleasing contrast to the rest.</p>

<div id='i065'  class='figcenter id051'>

<p>Fig. 47.</p>
</div>
<img src='images/i_065.jpg' alt='' class='ig051' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>The centers can be set at any angle with the
cutter shaft and a pineapple pattern can be made
<span class='pageno' title='68' id='Page_68'></span>on straight surfaces, by executing one part at one
angle, then reversing the rest that carries the
centers, and finish the remainder, one part of the
pattern crossing the other.</p>

<p class='c006'>I present here views of a novel ornament which
exhibits great mechanical ingenuity and manual
dexterity, but is otherwise of no value. It consists,
in one form, of a globe with a series of rings
or globes inside, and a six-armed spur projecting
through holes—all cut out of one solid piece. Fig.
47.</p>

<div id='i066'  class='figcenter id052'>
<div class='ic052'>
<p>Fig. 48.</p>
</div>
<img src='images/i_066.jpg' alt='' class='ig052' />
</div>

<p class='c006'><a href='#i066'>Fig. 48</a> shows how the points are turned. After
the internal rings are cut out with a quadrant tool
like <a href='#i067a'>Fig. 49</a>, and the spur also severed, by cutting
in the ends of the holes (not boring them out
<span class='pageno' title='69' id='Page_69'></span>solid), the globe is put in a shell chuck, with
three set screws in it, as shown. The set screws
go through the holes in the globe, and the cross
pieces, in between the spurs, serve to steady the
job. Any number of points may be turned in
the globe. <a href='#i067b'>Fig. 50</a> shows a polygon with many
spurs turned inside. At first sight it would appear
that the tool, severing the rings, would cut
off the points also, but it will be seen that this is
not the case, for the holes being bored so as to
<span class='pageno' title='70' id='Page_70'></span>leave a core standing (which afterward serves to
make the points of the spur), the severing tool
falls into the holes and goes no further, and each
division serves as a guide for the tool in the next
hole, so that the globe is made the same size,
without jags. The quadrant tool, shown before,
must be followed round the shell in the act of
cutting it out, so that it will make the same round,
and the globe must be shifted in the chuck, to
reach all the holes. It is no easy task to make
this little affair, for all it looks so simple.</p>

<p class='c015'><a href='#i069'>Fig. 51</a> is another, a little more ornate and of a
different pattern. The process is essentially the
same, except that there are no spurs and a solid
disk is left inside. This disk is turned out of a
ball, left inside the exterior shell. One side of it
is squared up before the ball is cut free from the
globe, and the job is then reversed and the other
side squared. The ball is then cut free, and the
<span class='pageno' title='72' id='Page_72'></span>loose disk is held fast between a flat-ended driver
in the live spindle, and a loose, flat-ended button
on the back center. The diameter is then decided
through the hole which is toward the reader.</p>

<p>Fig. 52.</p>
</div>
<img src='images/i_070.jpg' alt='' class='ig056' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>A little tool, which is very convenient for making
small screws, is here shown in <a href='#i070'>Fig. 52</a>, rather
out of place, but it was overlooked before. In
construction it explains itself. Holes of different
sizes are made in a steel rod, and the end filed into
shape, as seen. It has been found difficult by
some to make these cutters work, but that was
because they were not properly made. The
trouble lies in drilling the hole. When the drill
starts at first, the hole is larger on the outside, so
that the screw blank, when cut, gets tighter as it
goes in, and twists it off.</p>

<p class='c006'>The remedy is, to drill the hole in some distance
and then turn off the outside end, so that it
gets where the bore is the same size. This refers
<span class='pageno' title='73' id='Page_73'></span>only to small bolts, a sixteenth of an inch in diameter;
where they are large, the trouble mentioned
is not experienced.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is convenient to have two sizes in the tool so
that the heaviest part of the work can be done by
one cutter, the tool reversed by turning it over in
the fork of the jaws, and finishing the blank with
the last cutter. A watchmaker’s fine saw is to be
used to sever the screw from the rod. The tool
itself is to fit in the spindle of the tail stock, and
the screw wire is held by a drill chuck.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the matter of ornamental work, there are
other details and plans in vogue among experienced
turners, which can only be alluded to, not
discussed at length, for the reason that the styles
are so numerous that an elaborate work might be
made of them alone, with great profit. The scroll
chuck or geometrical chuck, as it is sometimes
called, is a complicated piece of mechanism, too
costly for general use, and too limited in its application,
to mechanics in general, to be of much
utility. It does such work as may be seen on
bank bills. The chuck plate, on which the work
is fixed, is connected, by a train of gearing on its
back, with a fixed gear about the spindle on the
head stock, so that when the relation these gears
bear to one another is altered, the motion of the
work on the chuck is accelerated or retarded, or
<span class='pageno' title='74' id='Page_74'></span>is made to assume certain positions. An elliptic
chuck is quite another thing, the work done by
it is shown in <a href='#i072'>Fig. 53</a>, which consists, chiefly, of
ornamental designs disposed in a certain order.
In fact, the changes that can be made are infinite.</p>

<img src='images/i_072.jpg' alt='' class='ig057' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>Mandrels—arbors, as
many call them—are very
useful tools. Mandrels
are made of wood and
steel—usually steel, and
never of wood, unless for
some special reason. As,
for instance, when a
large brass ring has to be
turned. For this use a
wooden mandrel is cheaper and more quickly
made than a steel one. Besides, it is quite as
good. Wooden mandrels should have iron center
plates let in them, so that they will run true;
if the center was made in the wood itself, it would
be liable to run out. Take a piece of sheet iron,
one eighth of an inch thick and one inch square,
hammer the corners thin, then turn them over at
right angles with the plate. This gives four
sharp corners, so that, when driven in the end of
a block, it will not slip; three small screws will
hold the plate to the mandrel so that it cannot get
loose. The center must then be countersunk, as
<span class='pageno' title='75' id='Page_75'></span>any other is. Such a mandrel, made of hard
wood, hickory for instance, will last a long time.</p>

<p class='c006'>Fibrous wood such as white oak, makes a good
mandrel, for the reason that work, driven on it,
compresses the fibers instead of scraping them, so
that the size of the mandrel is unchanged.</p>

<p class='c006'>Steel mandrels should be turned two in one, or
largest in the middle, for small work, each end
being a different size. Each end should be thoroughly
centered with a drill, and countersunk,
and a flat place filed so that the dog will hold;
not a scratch with a tool should ever be made in
one, though few persons will take the pains to
avoid doing this.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is unnecessary to tell the mechanic he must
have a rack for his tools, but we may tell the beginner
so, and he will find it a great convenience.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now-a-days, the twist drills, made and sold in
all the tool stores, are so uniformly superior to
any thing that can be made by hand, or by individuals,
and are, moreover, so cheap, that it is
foolish to make drills. Those who have never
used them, should not fail to order sets. They
run all sizes, from a needle to an inch.</p>

<p class='c006'>There are not a few turners who spoil work
simply from heedlessness. Not because they do
not know any better, but because they are averse
to taking a little extra pains. If a mandrel runs
<span class='pageno' title='76' id='Page_76'></span>out of truth a very little, sooner than alter it, or
make a new one, they will try to “make it do.”
The result is easily seen when work is to be put
together. Moreover, many persons use little caution
in setting their work in the lathe. Instead
of always putting it in the same place, driving it
from the same side of the face plate, it is entered
at hap-hazard. It is not good to get into the habit
of doing work in this way, for it soon leads to
recklessness.</p>

<p class='c006'>Some are too lazy to go and grind their tools,
when they know it should be done, and continue
to use them to the ultimate damage of the work.
It is easy for the practiced eye to see these apparently
small things, for they constitute a great part
of the difference between a good workman and a
bad one.</p>

<h3 id='section_x_1' class='c014'>ORNAMENTAL WOODS.</h3>

<p class='c015'>In the matter of wood working, the amateur
has a field as wide and attractive as the most enthusiastic
could wish. Of course, under this head
only those that are ornamental are considered,
leaving the plainer and rougher materials for domestic
purposes.</p>

<h3 id='section_x_2' class='c016'>VARIETIES.</h3>

<p class='c015'>Most amateurs ransack the stores of dealers in
foreign woods, for rich and rare varieties, leaving
our own native woods for others, of deeper hue
and harder grain. Yet it would be difficult to
find more beautifully veined wood than chestnut,
butternut, some varieties of ash, the root of the
black walnut, California rosewood, and oak; all
of which are indigenous.</p>

<p class='c006'>In foreign woods there are innumerable varieties,
but as comparatively few of them are to be
had, there can be nothing gained to the amateur
by mere enumeration. I have said comparatively
few are to be had in shops, and that is true for
<span class='pageno' title='78' id='Page_78'></span>this reason; the woods the amateur can readily
obtain, are the woods of commerce; that is, those
used in the arts and trades. No one imports
woods at a venture, or on chance of sale. Dealers
know their customers, and when, by chance, they
find a captain of some foreign trader, who has a
fancy lot which he has brought over, they send
word to their best buyers, who come and view
the lot, and take that which suits them, and the
rest, worm-eaten and “wind-shaken,” it may be,
is either burnt up, or thrown on one side for some
button maker, who may find in the short odds
and ends a profitable bargain. I shall, therefore,
mention but a few of the leading varieties of
choice woods, and these the most marked and
contrasted. Very many differ only in the name,
and, as far as mere exterior goes, are hardly distinguishable
from each other, while others are
positively ugly.</p>

<h3 id='section_x_3' class='c016'>SNAKE WOOD.</h3>

<p class='c015'>Prominent on the list of foreign woods is snake
wood, or, as it is sometimes called, leopard wood.
The markings and mottlings in this wood are
certainly superb in fine specimens. I have now
before me a small vase, made of this material,
which exhibits the most beautiful cloudings and
veinings. The pattern, so to speak, is in alternate
<span class='pageno' title='79' id='Page_79'></span>black and red blotches, like those on the back of a
snake. When varnished and French polished,
these are brought out in strong relief, and the
effect is very fine. There is one drawback to its
use, however, and that is its brittleness. Notwithstanding
the lathe be run at a high speed, it
will frequently sliver and crack in the most unlooked-for
and vexatious manner, and it is unsafe
to undertake any very delicate or fine work that
requires time and minute separation on the surface
in this material; for general work, however,
which has mouldings and convolutions on it, it is
easily manipulated, and is susceptible of a brilliant
polish. Further: it has the advantage of being
“fast colors,” which is more than can be said
of many other foreign woods. Whatever color
may be developed in turning, will be retained to
the end of time. This is not true of either tulip
or granadilla wood. Both of these are brilliant
in the extreme, when freshly cut, but by exposure
to the air, fade away into the most sombre colors.</p>

<h3 id='section_x_4' class='c016'>TULIP WOOD.</h3>

<p class='c015'>This is a moderately hard wood, of a peculiar salmon-pink,
veined with reddish brown and gray.
The veinings are chiefly parallel with the grain,
not straight, of course, but wavy and mottled.
As previously remarked, it is beautiful when first
<span class='pageno' title='80' id='Page_80'></span>cut, but gradually fades into a dingy, reddish
brown. It is a handsome wood for contrasting
with ebony, or any dark variety, and is chiefly
used for inlaying costly furniture, such as musical
instruments, work boxes, etc., etc. It is undeniably
handsome, however, and by no means to be
disparaged.</p>

<h3 id='section_x_5' class='c016'>GRANADILLA.</h3>

<p class='c015'>This is commonly called cocoa wood. It is
hard, finely-veined, and capable of a handsome
polish. It is largely used in the manufacture of
table and pocket cutlery, for the handles. It
comes in logs, from two to eight inches in diameter,
and is one of the most easily worked
woods. Quantities of it are employed for the
handles of seals or letter stamps, in which instruments
its brownish yellow color and markings
must be familiar to many. It fades, however, so
that in time it becomes almost uniform in its tone.</p>

<h3 id='section_x_6' class='c016'>TAMARIND.</h3>

<p class='c015'>This wood is very unfrequently met with. I
obtained, by chance, a large log of a wood-worker,
and was highly pleased with it. It can scarcely
be called variegated, except so finely as to be unnoticeable,
but for a rich brown color and tint it
is unapproachable. It is chocolate brown in hue,
<span class='pageno' title='81' id='Page_81'></span>and so hard and close in fibre, as to rive like the
husk of a cocoanut, while under a burnisher alone
it polishes like ivory. It is seldom one meets
with a wood so wholly satisfactory, in its general
nature, for all kinds of work where a hard grain
and fine surface is desirable.</p>

<h3 id='section_x_7' class='c016'>CAM WOOD.</h3>

<p class='c015'>This is a dye wood; that is, the shavings
boiled in water, or treated with alcohol, yield a
handsome dye, which is largely used in the arts.
It is moderately hard, in about the same degree
as mahogany, and is plain in surface; it is handsome
for inlaying and veneering in contrast with
ebony, but changes to a brown with age.</p>

<h3 id='section_x_8' class='c016'>BOX WOOD.</h3>

<p class='c015'>This is so well known to be a fine-grained, buff
yellow color, and easily worked wood, as to need
little further explanation of its characteristics. It
is becoming scarcer and dearer every year, but is
of little general value to the amateur from its
monotonous sameness; one piece being like all the
others; whereas, with snake wood, or granadilla,
perpetual surprises await one. Refuse box wood,
in odd-shaped pieces, can be bought very cheap
from those who make it a business to fit up blocks
for engravers, and also from wood-type makers.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' title='82' id='Page_82'></span>
<h3 id='section_x_9' class='c016'>LAUREL ROOT.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c015'>This is a peculiar wood, and, in my opinion,
more peculiar than pretty. It has a singular
feeling under the tool, cutting much like cheese or
gum; like any thing else, in fact, but wood. In
veining, it closely resembles brier wood and bird’s
eye maple; pipes have been made of it. It is
quite sound, but cannot be said to be handsome.
It is the root of the common swamp laurel, I am
told, and requires long seasoning and drying to
be manipulated.</p>

<h3 id='section_x_10' class='c016'>WHITE HOLLY.</h3>

<p class='c015'>This is a pure white wood, very easily bent,
turned, and cut, straight of grain, and very useful
for inlaying. Quantities of needle cases, fans, and
such wares, are made of it. It is a native of this
country, though the best is said to come from
England. This seems quite unnecessary, for I
have picked out of my wood-pile quantities of
white holly, as handsome in color and in grain, as
one could wish to see.</p>

<h3 id='section_x_11' class='c016'>EBONY.</h3>

<p class='c015'>Every one has his prejudice, and I have no
doubt but that many will consider me lacking in
taste if I condemn this wood. It has one sole redeeming
feature—blackness—which renders it indispensable
<span class='pageno' title='83' id='Page_83'></span>in many cases. Yet I have seen rock
maple dyed black, that put ebony to shame for
richness of color and fineness of grain. No ebony
that I ever saw was <em>black</em>, naturally. It was
brown, and became black by oiling and varnishing.
There is a variety, called “bastard ebony,”
which is full of whitish brown stripes, and is soft
like pine, but the true ebony is not to me a precious
wood, although it is expensive, and, in some
cases, undeniably handsome. In spite of all selection,
aided by good judges, I have frequently
found my “black ebony” any thing but black;
it is full of season streaks and cracks, and splits in
the most perverse and unexpected manner.</p>

<h3 id='section_x_12' class='c016'>OLIVE WOOD.</h3>

<p class='c015'>This is the wood of the olive tree, and is chiefly
valuable for its odor; that is, to those who like
that odor. In color it is like white wood, and is
without any marked feature, except that of scent.</p>

<h3 id='section_x_13' class='c016'>SANDAL WOOD.</h3>

<p class='c015'>This is a fragrant wood, light buff-colored, and
very soft, and straight in grain. In general it is
like pine wood, splitting straight, working easily,
and valuable solely for its odor.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' title='84' id='Page_84'></span>
<h3 id='section_x_14' class='c016'>ROSE WOOD.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c015'>This is an exceedingly beautiful wood, and is
so well known, in its general nature, as to need
no recommendation. In marking, it is so delicate
as to admit of the finest work, and yet retain the
beauty of the pattern.</p>

<h3 id='section_x_15' class='c016'>CURLED MAPLE.</h3>

<p class='c015'>This is one of the most beautiful of our native
woods; in point of color, and power of retaining
it, in marking and in variety, it is, to me, one of
the most beautiful of all woods. The vein has a
sinuous sweep and curve to it, which is heightened
by varnishing and polishing, to a marked degree.
All of the handsome woods, however, have a peculiar
intractability, so to speak, which renders them
slow and tedious to work. In fact, it is just this
stubbornness of grain which renders them beautiful,
for, by running in all directions, interlacing
the fibres, so that the end of the grain is alternately
presented side by side with the parallel
grain, the light is caught and retained on dead
surfaces that absorb it, making those beautiful contrasts
which the most uncultivated admire.</p>

<h3 id='section_x_16' class='c016'>BIRD’S EYE MAPLE.</h3>

<p class='c015'>This is also a handsome wood, full of round
spots interspersed with circular markings, the
<span class='pageno' title='85' id='Page_85'></span>whole forming a handsome contrast when well
handled. Pear and apple tree woods are also
handsome, but none of the native woods exhibit
so great variety in tint and markings, as those
which grow in tropical countries. There is no
occasion to continue a mere list of woods which
can be found in any shop, and this branch of the
subject will be dropped.</p>

<h3 id='section_x_17' class='c016'>TREATMENT.</h3>

<p class='c015'>The first thing that occurs to the workman
when he possesses or sees a handsome piece of
wood, is: What shall I make with it? Many
kinds of wood show well in large works, but in
smaller wares, such as sleeve buttons, and napkin
rings, they look like common wood; it is, therefore,
labor lost to spend time in working out a
nice job to show the veining and marking of the
wood, because such veining is not brought out
fully. The first care is to select sound wood. It
is one of the most vexatious things in the world
to have a nice job nearly done, and find a large
worm hole extending right through the center of
it, interfering with the tool and destroying the
beauty of the piece. In such a case, the only resort
is to plug it up, but no matter how skillfully
this is done, the plug is certain to show, and
always mars the appearance. Some kinds of
<span class='pageno' title='86' id='Page_86'></span>foreign woods are almost always worm eaten.
Snake wood, for instance, is very liable to that
fault, and too much care cannot be taken in examining
it. Ebony is not so liable to it, and
native woods are peculiarly free from it.</p>

<h3 id='section_xi_1' class='c014'>WOOD TURNING.</h3>

<p>Fig. 54.</p>
</div>
<img src='images/i_085.jpg' alt='' class='ig058' />
</div>

<p class='c015'>In turning wood, the speed cannot be too high,
or the tool too sharp. The faster the speed, the
more perfect the surface produced by the tool. In
centering, also, it is necessary to use care in getting
a sound place to begin on; otherwise, when
in the middle of a job, the centers change and the
work is spoiled. This, of course, relates to work
that is turned on centers, such as chess-men, penholders,
rulers with ornamental ends, “what-not”
legs; in fact, anything of that class. The driving
center or one that goes in the head of the lathe,
commonly called the live center—in opposition to
the one in the back end of the lathe head, which
does not move, and is called the dead center—should
be properly made, or
much confusion will be the result.
Very many use the common
bit, like <a href='#i085'>Fig. 54</a>, which is
a very poor device for the purpose. There
being no guard at the corners of the bit, they are
liable to slip when strain is brought on the work
<span class='pageno' title='88' id='Page_88'></span>by the tool; it is, therefore, necessary to make
the driving bit, or center, like <a href='#i086a'>Fig. 55</a>, which represents
a section through the front edge and the
flat pieces at the top, to prevent the work from
slipping.</p>

<div id='i086a'  class='figleft id059'>
<div class='ic059'>
<p>Fig. 55.</p>
</div>
<img src='images/i_086a.jpg' alt='' class='ig059' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>In turning very small work, say penholders
for example, I have
found centers useless
to drive from, and
after trying dogs, commonly
used for metal
turning, and many
other devices, have found no more efficient or
expeditious plan than to round the end of the
wood slightly with a pocket-knife, as in <a href='#i086b'>Fig. 56</a>;
insert the rounded end in a chuck, and place the
other in the back center. In this way, I am able
to command the whole range of the work,
from end to end,
without interference,
and to have the
small tip where it is
necessary to have it to keep steady; that is, near
the center.</p>

<img src='images/i_086b.jpg' alt='' class='ig060' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>I <em>saw</em> all my pieces for turning, into square
strips. I never split them; splitting shivers and
cracks hard and precious wood, and makes unsound
that which was previously sound.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' title='89' id='Page_89'></span>Besides, it is more economical and more expeditious.
If you cannot saw them yourself,
handily, take them to the nearest wood-worker
who has a circular saw, and he will do it for a
trifle.</p>

  <h2 id='chapter_xii' class='c004'>CHAPTER XII.</h2>
<h3 id='section_xii_1' class='c014'>TOOLS FOR WOOD TURNING.</h3>

<p class='c015'>It does not seem necessary to go into the discussion
of tools, or shapes of tools, for wood
turning, for the grand and great reliance for
roughing is the gouge, and a skillful workman
will do as many things with it as the Russian
carpenter is said to do with his axe, which is almost
his only tool. For smoothing, there is the
flat chisel, and for special work, every one will
find tools, or, rather, make those he finds best
suited to his needs.</p>

<p class='c006'>I would, however, here say with great earnestness,
that it makes all the difference in the world
what kind of steel you get in your tools, whether
they are worth any thing or not. I never found
<em>any</em> turning tools in stores, that I considered
worth any thing. They are generally made for
working soft woods, such as pine, but the amateur
needs tools of a different class and temper. Hard
woods are full of dust on the outside, and seem
more or less impregnated with silica, the principle
which forms the coating on the stalks of rye and
<span class='pageno' title='91' id='Page_91'></span>cereal grains generally, which destroys the cutting
edge in a short time, and also draws the temper.
I have therefore found it convenient to make my
own tools out of the best steel I could buy, and
temper them myself. The difference is very
marked, for where I formerly went to the grindstone
every few minutes, I now use a tool a long
while, thus saving many steps and minutes.</p>

<p class='c006'>I therefore repeat—choose your steel from such
as you find the best, and harden it yourself. If
you don’t know how, a few trials will enable you
to do it “everytime,” as the saying is. I have
found Sanderson’s, Jessops, and Stubbs, all good
steel; also Park Brothers American steel first-rate
for general work. No doubt there are some who
will take up this book, and for the first time read
of the matters contained therein, to whom hardening
and tempering are “all Greek;” to such I will
explain the process.</p>

<p class='c006'>Very often amateurs buy tools which are good
if they were only properly hardened, and to them
also, it may be of service—if they do not already
know it—to be able to do this simple thing.</p>

<div class='chapter'></div>
<div>  <span class='pageno' title='92' id='Page_92'></span></div>
  <h2 id='chapter_xiii' class='c004'>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>
<h3 id='section_xiii_1' class='c014'>TOOL TEMPERING, ETC.</h3>

<p class='c015'>The great object is to harden at as low a heat
as possible, so as not to injure the steel. The
tool must not be treated as a blacksmith does
iron, nothing like so hot, but so as to be of a dull
cherry color. Steel that will not harden at this
heat is poor stock. When so heated, plunge it
into cold water. This will make the tool hard
and brittle, like glass, so that it is not fit to cut
with; you must then rub it bright on a piece of
emery paper or a grindstone, and hold it in the fire
for a second or so at a time, until the temper is
drawn to the right degree of toughness and tenacity.
This will be, for turning-tools for <em>hard</em> wood,
of a dull blue-brown, say violet, color. Straw
brown is hard enough to cut steel, and you do not
want such a temper for wood in general, but for
some purposes, it is desirable to have a very hard
tool. When the edge <em>crumbles</em>, it is too hard, and
must be lowered in temper; when it rounds over,
or dulls quickly, it is too soft, and needs to be
<span class='pageno' title='93' id='Page_93'></span>hardened. This much in the way of tools of
which more will be said hereafter.</p>

<p class='c006'>Many things are not held in the centers at all,
but are grasped by chucks, of different patterns
or shapes. This, to me, is the most satisfactory
way of turning, inasmuch as it allows perfect
liberty and sweep in all directions, and does not
restrict the fancy or imagination of the workman.</p>

<div class='inlinecontainer'>

<p class='c006'>It is not necessary to mention <em>what</em> kinds of work
can be done, for that will occur to every one, but
I will merely give here an illustration of the facility
which the chuck affords for all kinds of
work. <a href='#i091a'>Fig. 57</a> is a box cover, and being held at
first by the corners, permits the inside to be
turned out to fit the bottom. Afterwards, whatever
finish or pattern is desired, can be given to
the top. There is in every lathe, a center screw,
like <a href='#i091b'>Fig. 58</a>, which is useful for holding work
<span class='pageno' title='94' id='Page_94'></span>that has, or is to have, a hole in it, but for fine
work it is not suitable, for the obvious reason
that the screw spoils it. <a href='#i091a'>Fig. 57</a> is the scroll chuck,
and is a favorite instrument of mine. I could
dispense with many things—the face-plate of the
lathe for one—better than I could with this. If
I want to make a sleeve-button, there is my
friend, the scroll chuck, ready to hold the piece
true to the center, without any adjustment whatever
and hold it firmly, too. If I wish to bore out a
ring, the chuck will grasp true, and hold it without
spring: in fact, not to dilate unnecessarily, I
call it the one thing no turner can afford to be
without. There are many in the market, but the
best one for general work of this class, I have
found to be that made by A. F. Cushman, of
Hartford, Connecticut. He makes a very small
chuck, also, for holding drills, that is exceedingly
convenient for them, and for holding screw wire,
or any work of that class. The “Beach Chuck,”
made by the Morse Twist Drill Company of New
Bedford, Massachusetts, is also a good chuck, but
as I am not now discussing the merits of chucks,
I will return to the subject in hand—treatment of
woods.</p>

<p class='c006'>I do not design, in this little work, telling any
one how to hold a tool, for it is to be presumed
that at least that part of the craft has been acquired.
<span class='pageno' title='95' id='Page_95'></span>Even if I did essay to tell them, I could
no more impart such knowledge than one could
skate by seeing another person do it. Observation
and practice are the only teachers.</p>

  <h2 id='chapter_xiv' class='c004'>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>
<h3 id='section_xiv_1' class='c014'>ARTISTIC WOOD TURNING.</h3>

<p class='c015'>Some of the most beautiful work, really artistic
in every sense of the word, is made by laying
up woods of different colors, <i>but of the same general
character as regards hardness</i>. If this latter precaution,
which I have italicised, be neglected, the
result will be wholly unsatisfactory, for where
two or more woods of different densities are laid
up together, side by side, the tool will act upon
the hardest very well, but will glide or spring
over the inferior material, and thus leave an uneven
surface. White holly and ebony work well
enough together, but I do not consider ebony a
hard wood. Of course there are many who will
dispute this assertion, but it is easy enough to
pick out specimens of any wood that are hard, but
what I mean to say is, that, in general, it is not a
truly hard wood, like rosewood or even cocoanut.
White holly is almost as soft as pine, and contrasts
finely with the only natural black wood
that we have. There is one other black wood,
of which I have seen specimens, that is perfection
<span class='pageno' title='97' id='Page_97'></span>itself, so far as color, grain, and strength are concerned.
Indeed, it can scarcely be said to have a
grain, so firm and solid is it in texture. It turns
like horn, or ivory, and is of the “darkest, deepest,
deadliest,” black. Unfortunately, I cannot
give the name of it, for the reason that the gentleman
who gave it to me, did not know himself
what it was, and he obtained it from the captain
of a vessel trading to Africa.<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c017'><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Mere white and black wood, side by side, do
not look well unless some kind of pattern or design
is observed, and if the pattern is obtained
only at great expense of time and labor, it is also
unsatisfactory. I shall show, further along, how
different designs can be produced rapidly and accurately,
with but comparatively little labor.</p>

<p class='c006'>By inlaying, too, many most beautiful designs
can be produced, with but little labor compared
to that which is generally bestowed upon such
work. This kind of ornamentation is beautiful
upon work tables, work boxes, cigar stands, paper
knives, fan handles, fancy boxes, inkstands, card
cases, vases, picture frames, penholders, sleeve
buttons, ear-rings, chess and checker men, napkin
rings, fancy drawer knobs, jewel caskets, watch
holders, glove boxes, in fact, the whole array of
<span class='pageno' title='98' id='Page_98'></span>fine cabinet work, looks better when neatly and
tastefully inlaid with woods that match and harmonize
with the subject, and with each other. I
think that some of the methods I practice are new
to most persons, and I am sure they will be found
accurate and expeditious; which last is a point of
no small importance; for when a person works a
long time over an elaborate thing, he gets terribly
tired of it after while, if it is slow and plodding.
In fact, where there is much that is uniform
in character, as in making a check pattern, in
black and white colors in squares, not over the
tenth of one inch wide—it is impossible to make
any thing like regularity, or fine fitting, and close
joints, by handling each piece separately.</p>

<p class='c006'>I therefore have a variety of what I call
“stock” on hand, ready laid up, in all colors and
dimensions, so that I can choose from it exactly
as I would pick out a tool. This stock consists
of wood laid up in the patterns shown in Figs.
59-67, and of sizes varying according to my designs,
but generally very near the sizes here
shown.</p>

<p class='c006'>These are laid up in long strips, say twelve
inches long, or as may be conveniently handled.
They are all sawed out with a fine circular saw,
by some one who understands cutting hard wood
for this purpose. The stuff must be shoved
<span class='pageno' title='99' id='Page_99'></span>through the saw with a very regular, gradual
feed, so as to cut a smooth surface, and if the saw
is not right for cutting smooth on the side, it
must be made so; for it will not do to plane the
strips after they are sawed, as there never would
be any uniformity between them, and the joints
would be very imperfect. In gluing them up,
there is nothing particular to be observed, except
that the glue must be very hot, laid on well with
a stiff brush, and the stuff clamped between two
thick boards, which have been planed perfectly
true on the faces; so that the union will be perfect
between the strips. In this way the job will be
<span class='pageno' title='100' id='Page_100'></span>well done, and the sections will show uniformly.
As it is the sections that are mainly used, this is a
matter of great importance; for when it is necessary
to have an ornamental border to a work-box,
for example, it is only requisite to saw off as
many sections, from the end of any of the blocks,
as may be desired; as in <a href='#i098a'>Fig. 68</a>. It is then a
simple and easy thing to lay them in, one after
another, in the place that has been left for them.</p>

<p class='c006'>I do not saw off each square strip by itself before
I glue the stock, but I lay up several flat
pieces, as in <a href='#i098b'>Fig. 69</a>, which represents one <em>end</em>
section of the strips, longer than it
is high, the saw removes some in
cutting, so that when I saw down
through the top vertically, as
shown by the straight line A, I obtain
square strips in long pieces, but all glued together
so they are easy to handle, these I afterward
glue together again, so that white and black
<span class='pageno' title='101' id='Page_101'></span>alternate, as in the checker-board, and I then have
the pattern precisely uniform in all the length of
the stock. I claim originality for this plan, and
also expedition in execution; more than either I
get entire uniformity. Of course it is easy to
make any other pattern in the same way, and it is
surprising to see how many rectangular and acute-angled
patterns can be made with these sections.
It is sometimes possible to get veneers of the
right thickness, but any veneer cutter will saw
the wood as desired.</p>

<p class='c006'>Since the paragraph above was written, I have
seen some “Tunbridge Ware” work made in
England, which is, I am sure, done in the same
way. Therefore, I am not the originator of the
idea, but I can certify that it is a good and a
quick way of making very elaborate patterns.</p>

<h3 id='section_xv_1' class='c014'>STAMP INLAYING.</h3>

<p class='c015'>Of course there are times and places where the
sameness and rigidity of angular patterns are tedious,
and the eye and hand, fatigued by it,
desire a change into something more graceful and
harmonious in effect. The smaller the pattern,
the more tedious, irksome, and expensive the
goods. To avoid delay is one object of the workman,
but to obtain perfection is the chief. In
order to do this, we must have some plan or some
tool to multiply the same shape with great rapidity
and regularity.</p>

<div id='i101a'  class='figcenter id074'>
<div class='ic074'>
<p>Fig. 70.</p>
</div>
<img src='images/i_101a.jpg' alt='' class='ig074' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>In fine workmanship, or rather in small pieces,
it would be impossible to cut out any great number
with the certainty of their being at all similar;
some would be large, some small, and all different.
Let us imagine that it is desired to inlay a laurel
wreath, or a garland of stars in an elliptic pattern
about the edge of a box cover, as in <a href='#i101a'>Fig. 70</a>. It
will be seen that to cut each one in with a chisel
would be an endless task. I therefore propose
to do it much quicker than it can be done by
<span class='pageno' title='103' id='Page_103'></span>other plan, and that is by a stamp. I make a
steel stamp, or punch, of the exact size of the
pattern I wish to let in the box, and am careful to
have it bevel inwards, from the edges toward the
top, as in <a href='#i101b'>Fig. 71</a>, not only to avoid breaking
down the edges, but to make a clean, sharp impression
in the
wood. It is necessary
to cut in
pretty deep, for,
with all your care, you cannot avoid breaking the
edge to some extent, and it can only be practised on
<span class='pageno' title='104' id='Page_104'></span>any solid, sound wood, <em>not veneered</em>. Except for
large patterns, I do not put veneers in these incisions,
or stamp markings, as I could not cut them
out so small, as the pattern shows in the engraving,
but I either make a cement of white lead, and
push that into the holes, or, using the same
stamp I cut in the pattern in the wood with, I cut
pieces out of thin sheet German silver, and push
them in with great ease. If I use silver, I am
careful to cut in below the surface of the cover
on the box, so that I can put the cover in the
lathe again, and refinish the top so as to be flush
with the silver. In this way I get a true, uniform,
and even pattern, which looks as if it had grown
in its place; for grace and elegance of appearance,
it cannot be surpassed. Where it is absolutely
necessary to use a chisel and cutting tool to inlay
with, I still make stamps, even so large as half an
inch superficial area, for they are soon cut out,
and serve to mark the outlines for the chisel, so
that it is easier to cut the pattern by their aid.</p>

<div id='i101b'  class='figright id075'>
<div class='ic075'>
<p>Fig. 71.</p>
</div>
<img src='images/i_101b.jpg' alt='' class='ig075' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>In straight lines, or even in letting in circles,
parts of circles, ellipses, in fact, any curved or
angular work with veneers, I invariably cut the
pattern <em>out</em> before laying it on the box, and then
fit the other colored pieces in the spaces left.
Very many veneers cannot be handled at all when
dry, without breaking all to pieces and spoiling
<span class='pageno' title='105' id='Page_105'></span>the pattern. It will be necessary to soak ebony,
for instance, for some time before you want to use
it. With this precaution, you can cut it in any
shape without danger. It is the same with maple
veneer. When I have cut out an intricate pattern
in ebony, and wish to inlay the same with
holly, I obtain an exact duplicate of the shape the
holly should have, by placing it, <em>wet</em>, over the
ebony, holding it firmly, so that it cannot slip,
and then rapping the holly with the end of a tool
handle. In this way a fac simile of the pattern is
transferred in wet lines to the holly, and you have
only to follow them over with a lead pencil to get
a perfect shape. Then take a sharp square-ended
knife, and laying the veneer on a hard surface,
cut slowly and carefully all round the marks, and
after a few incisions, you will have the satisfaction
of seeing it come out perfect.</p>

<h3 id='section_xvi_1' class='c014'>DESIGNS IN MOSAIC.</h3>

<p class='c015'>These methods greatly expedite the <em>labor</em> of
inlaying, for mere labor much of it is; that is,
when repetition of the pattern is frequent, as it is
in small designs.</p>

<p class='c006'>The great trouble and vice of amateur mechanics
is <em>haste</em>; they are too anxious to see the
result of a design to give it proper attention in
detail, and, as a consequence, it lacks that nicety
and uniform elegance that characterize the shop-made
goods. For where men work by the day,
they are not too energetic as a rule.</p>

<h3 id='section_xvi_2' class='c016'>DESIGNS IN MOSAIC.</h3>

<p class='c015'>By this I mean the employment of small bits of
different colored woods to produce a certain effect.
I have seen many that were made to represent
foliage of trees, the wood being stained green, of
course, but these works of art seem to me labor
thrown away, and, except as mere curiosities, are
in no wise attractive; for no workman can do
<span class='pageno' title='107' id='Page_107'></span>more than <em>imitate</em> nature in this line, and it is a
poor imitation.</p>

<div id='i105'  class='figright id076'>
<div class='ic076'>
<p>Fig. 72.</p>
</div>
<img src='images/i_105.jpg' alt='' class='ig076' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>A legitimate branch of this line of work is that
wherein small bits, say of the size of <a href='#i105'>Fig. 72</a>, can
be conveniently used. When laid in nicely, and
the colors arranged to harmonize, they certainly
look well, resembling the straw
flower work, or inlaid straw
work of Japan. The wood may
be dyed any color desired, but it is much nicer to
use those colored by nature, which do not fade.
I give here a list of naturally colored woods, useful
for this kind of work.</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c019'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Black—Ebony.</div>
      <div class='line'>Red—Cam Wood, Tulip Wood.</div>
      <div class='line'>Yellow—Boxwood.</div>
      <div class='line'>White—Holly.</div>
      <div class='line'>Brown—Walnut, Cocoa.</div>
      <div class='line'>Red Brown—Spanish Cedar (cigar box).</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>These woods all inlay well except the Spanish
Cedar and Walnut, which are apt to chip and
sliver off on the edges, when cut thin. Cam wood
is a pretty red wood, very close in grain, but not
to be had in veneers, as it is used chiefly for
making dyes. Most of this kind of work looks
better when ranged in angles about a center,
though I recently saw a work-box in Boston,
which had an accurate representation of a worsted
<span class='pageno' title='108' id='Page_108'></span>pattern worked on a canvas, but as the workman
had unfortunately selected a very ugly pattern,
and the woods had faded, his labor was wholly
thrown away.</p>

<p class='c006'>After having arranged or laid one course in
mosaic work, it is comparatively easy to follow
the whole around, but it is absolutely essential
that the pieces to be let in should be fac similes
of each other, for unless this is the case, the pattern
will come out wrong when the ends are joined, or
where it meets. Great care must be observed in
this, and as it would be almost impossible to cut
slips of veneer so small, and be accurate, I prefer
to take a slip of wood, and saw off of the end,
having, of course, previously planed and callipered
the stick perfectly true. Here let me say,
that the saw I use for this purpose, is the watchmakers’
dividing saw, the same as jewellers use.
Some of the saws are scarcely larger than a horse
hair, while others are three-tenths of an inch deep
and very narrow. With this instrument I can
work very delicately as regards thinness and
smoothness of surface. It is also admirable for
scroll sawing, of which more hereafter.</p>

<p class='c006'>Of course, all these are small jobs, and small,
fine work; when it comes to more elaborate patterns,
such as are generally found on tables, work-boxes,
musical boxes, and similar things, it requires
<span class='pageno' title='109' id='Page_109'></span>more time, but as the pattern is large, it requires
no particular patience beyond that which
a <em>very</em> fine piece of work does. But where the
pieces are small, as in mosaic, it takes a great deal
of patience to pick up one after another, and no
small degree of artistic talent to bring them all in
in the right place.</p>

  <h2 id='chapter_xvii' class='c004'>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>
<h3 id='section_xvii_1' class='c014'>FINISHING THE OUTSIDE.</h3>

<p class='c015'>When the pattern has all been laid, the next
thing that remains is to finish the exterior, and
polish it or oil it as may be desired. To do this
it is, of course, necessary to use great care. The
veneers, if they have been used, are very thin,
about the twenty-fifth part of an inch, and there is
not much to come off. It must therefore be
scraped very carefully with a sharp scraper,
either in the lathe, or, if the work be a flat surface,
by a scraper held in the hand, and made of
sheet steel of the best quality. In using the
scraper, care must be taken to humor the grain
of the wood, so that it will not be roughened up
by being rubbed the wrong way. When it has
been scraped sufficiently smooth, it must be thoroughly
rubbed with sand paper, until it has an
even, uniform surface all over. If it is to be varnished
and polished, French polish as it is termed,
such as is seen on pianos, it will require a long time
and much experience to make it a success. The
reason is this: the polish is really given to the
<span class='pageno' title='111' id='Page_111'></span>gum of which the varnish is composed, and not to
the wood itself. The gum sinks into the pores of
the wood and fills them up, and hardens as it is
applied, but the fluids in which the gums are dissolved,
either turpentine or oil, evaporate comparatively
slowly, so that before each coat is applied,
the previous one must be dry and hard, or else
the next one will be streaky, and the surface will
be ridgy.</p>

<p class='c006'>The length of time depends greatly on the
weather; from three to six months being required
to properly dry and harden a piano-case so
that it will wear—six months is, however, extreme,
and is only the case in very warm weather.
It will easily be seen why so many amateurs fail
in producing that vitreous glaze, or polish, which
is so universally admired. Not one in fifty has
patience enough to wait until the first coat dries,
before the second is applied, and they keep trying
the varnish, to see if it won’t work, in a day or
two after it has been put on. It sometimes takes
ten days before the third coat is ready to apply
the next. It is a common fault to apply too much
varnish on the first coat. It is necessary to rub
it into the grain of the wood, so that it is thoroughly
charged with it, and sinks into the pores.
By rubbing it is merely meant to take a little on
the brush and cover the surface gradually, without
<span class='pageno' title='112' id='Page_112'></span>trying to make it look well or ill. The ground
work has to be put on first, before any thing can
be done toward ornamenting. After one coat has
been put on, it must be rubbed down with sand paper
to remove any varnish that may not have sunk
into the work, and when all is fair and smooth and
dry, a second coat may be applied and treated in
the same way. The third coat may be applied
rather more freely, and must be left to get thoroughly
hard before treating it. It must then be
rubbed freely with pumice stone flour, and water.
This will leave it bright and hard if the varnish
has been skillfully put on, and a coat of flowing
varnish may now be put on for the last. Flowing
varnish is so-called because it is lighter in body
than most varnishes, and is intended as the last of
all, to produce that elegant glossy surface which
characterizes all fine work.</p>

<p class='c006'>Many persons use shellac varnish, which is
simply gum lac (the proper name is “lac”),
which is a gum found in the Indies; the trade
give it the names of shell-lac and seed-lac, and
one other which I have forgotten: shell-lac is the
kind used for varnish. The gum is simply dissolved
in alcohol of high proof; the solution
being aided by exposure to a warm place and
agitation from time to time. As this varnish
dries immediately, or within an hour, owing to
<span class='pageno' title='113' id='Page_113'></span>the rapid evaporation of the alcohol; it is very
convenient for amateurs who are of an energetic
turn of mind, and wish to see their productions
turned and finished in a breath, as one may say.
It takes a fair polish, but is by no means so durable
or beautiful as copal or hard varnishes. On
some woods, as, for instance, cherry, pine, or
cedar, it is very appropriate, and looks well.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is quite easy to write these instructions and
observations down, but there is a dexterity, acquired
only by practice, which cannot be told to
any one, and the operator must, if possible, inform
himself by visiting the nearest cabinet or piano
factory, and see with his eyes for himself.</p>

<p class='c006'>I should have said previously that ivory black
introduced into shell-lac varnish, gives a very
good black lacquer, closely imitating japan, while
other colors, such as blue, carmine, green, or yellow,
have the effect of enamel when handsomely
rubbed down and polished with several coats. I
have seen some most beautiful knobs for drawers,
fancy handles, etc., made in this way, that looked
like porcelain.</p>

<p class='c006'>Oiled wood looks well in furniture, and there
may be some who desire to use it on fancy work.
It is simply linseed oil applied in successive coats;
but it requires time to dry, and always has a disagreeable
odor about it.</p>

<h3 id='section_xviii_1' class='c014'>INLAYING CONTINUED.</h3>

<p class='c015'>A very convenient tool for inlaying
veneers edgewise, so as to produce alternate
dark and white lines is made by taking
a piece of steel, one fourth of an inch
by one sixteenth thick, and making a
chisel, like <a href='#i112'>Fig. 73</a>. The bottom is
rounded to prevent it from digging in.
To use this tool, or to inlay fine white
and black lines, or white lines alone, all
over the surface of any piece of wood in
any pattern desired, it is only needful to
mark out the pattern first, incise it all
around with a sharp keen edge, such as
a knife blade broken off to form a square
end, and then follow the lines with this
tool, when the wood will come away, leaving
a clean channel, in which the veneer
may be inserted with expedition and
neatness. In crossing the corners, it is
necessary to use caution, so that they be
not broken away, for no inlaying looks
well if chipped, or ragged at the edges.
<span class='pageno' title='115' id='Page_115'></span>This is especially convenient for drawing lines
across mahogany boxes that have been put together
before inlaying was thought of for them.
The veneers should all be glued together, side
and side first, that is, if two colors are used, then
they will fit on the ends properly, and may be
handled with more expedition.</p>

<h3 id='section_xviii_2' class='c016'>GLUING IN VENEERS.</h3>

<p class='c015'>In a previous part of this little work I have advised
the use of waterproof cements for fine inlaying,
so that dampness will not affect them, but
as this is not always convenient, it is well to make
the glue so that it can be used and the work
finished off in a short time. This is easily done
by making the glue as thick as it will run, or so
that it is like a jelly. If applied in this condition,
it will set hard in thirty minutes, and the work
may be cut down without fear or danger of its
moving. I have done this frequently, in order to
see what kind of work I was making. Always
put a clamp on your work wherever you can, for
although the glue will adhere of itself to the
wood, it adheres much more strongly if pressed
down by a clamp. Also, never put a veneer on a
piece of work that is uneven, for although it may
set square under the pressure of the clamp, when
you come to scrape it, it will give way and yield
<span class='pageno' title='116' id='Page_116'></span>to the inequalities, and when varnished and
polished, will be full of depressions.</p>

<p class='c006'>Don’t be afraid to rub down with sand paper,
under the impression that you are spoiling the
work, but let the varnish get thoroughly dried,
and be hard before you attempt it. Be sure, also,
to remove every particle of varnish if you touch
it at all, otherwise that which remains will take a
coat while the bare wood will not take so much,
and you will have a surface full of scars and
ridges. It is not necessary to touch the wood in
rubbing down, but go down <em>to</em> the wood, so that
a waxy appearance is presented, and you will have
a handsome finish that will add greatly to the
beauty of the work. White holly is easily soiled
when used in connection with ebony, by the dust
from it, and it will be necessary to rub it, or scrape
it delicately, before varnishing, without touching
the ebony.</p>

<h3 id='section_xviii_3' class='c016'>IVORY.</h3>

<p class='c015'>This substance is certainly a most attractive
one to the turner. Pure in color, hard, solid and
strong beyond belief in texture or grain, it has
the fewest disadvantages of any substance we
use. It is easily dyed to any shade, and will hold
it a long while. Either for jewelry, or rather for
personal adornment, or articles of utility, it is
<span class='pageno' title='117' id='Page_117'></span>well adapted, and but for the cost of it would
be in general use. It is getting dearer and
scarcer each year. The best comes from Ceylon,
and that in least repute from African elephants;
the former is said to be much stronger and more
solid.</p>

<p class='c006'>Of its general manipulation there is not much
to be said, except that the workman will find it
trying to the edge of his tools. In all respects it
can be cut and turned like hard woods.</p>

<div id='i115'  class='figcenter id078'>
<div class='ic078'>
<p>Fig. 74.</p>
</div>
<img src='images/i_115.jpg' alt='' class='ig078' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>It is easily softened by immersion for a time in
weak acid, so that its friability, toughness, or
tendency to resist the carving tool, is destroyed,
and this without injuring the goods, unless the
acid is too strong.</p>

<p class='c006'>As it is so expensive in general, it is well for
the amateur to know that he can purchase it in all
shapes, either in squares like <a href='#i115'>Fig. 74</a>, or in flat,
cord-like slips, from dealers in it. I will mention
one person, F. Grote, 78 Fulton street, New York,
who generally has a good assortment of this kind.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is extremely convenient to find pieces of the
exact size and shape one needs, and it is also
<span class='pageno' title='118' id='Page_118'></span>economical, both in time and material, for all
ivory must be sawed, and that is slow work where
there are no facilities. After the article, whatever
it may be, is turned, it may be either dyed,
or polished in its natural color.</p>

<h3 id='section_xviii_4' class='c016'>POLISHING.</h3>

<p class='c015'>This is performed in the easiest way. A wet
rag will polish ivory, but in order to put on a
brilliant gloss, take starch, or Spanish white, saturate
a wet rag with it, and hold it on the work;
when dried off and rubbed with a woolen cloth or
a piece of chamois leather, it will have a brilliant
and durable gloss.</p>

<h3 id='section_xviii_5' class='c016'>DYEING IVORY.</h3>

<p class='c015'>I tried a great many plans and recipes for dyeing
ivory before I hit upon any that were in all
respects satisfactory. Most of them were nasty,
involved the purchase of drugs and dyes that
were sure to be adulterated, and the results were
vexatious, but one day, in dyeing some silk with
family dye color, prepared by Howe and Stevens,
of Boston, Massachusetts, the idea occurred to me
to try it on ivory. It succeeded to admiration,
and I had found what I had so long sought,
namely, a clean, cheap, simple and <em>sure</em> method
of coloring ivory to any shade needed, in a short
<span class='pageno' title='119' id='Page_119'></span>time. The color can always be had, ready for
use, in any town, as much so as a bottle of ink,
while the various shades and gradations of tint
are ready made to hand; there is no need of stale
urine, or any other mess,—simple immersion in
the hot liquid from ten to twenty-four hours will
give a permanent and brilliant hue to any article.
I have never seen such brilliant colors as these
dyes give. The solferino and the black are particularly
handsome, and are insoluble in water;
that is, the goods may be washed without injury.
The solferino will not bear <em>hard</em> rubbing in water,
but the black and other colors will, without injury.
The depth to which the color penetrates depends
upon the length of time the goods are immersed,
but twenty-four hours, and even six hours
in some cases, will answer all purposes. For chess-men,
the solferino is a splendid color, while all
the other tints can be had for other kinds of fancy
work.</p>

<p class='c006'>Ivory is particularly suitable for mosaic inlaying,
as it never chips, and can be cut into the smallest
and thinnest pieces without danger of fracture.
It will hold on wood with glue, though there are
other cements, stronger, for the purpose.</p>

<p class='c006'>It can also be dyed before inlaying, and afterwards
rubbed down to a uniform surface, but the
work must be done well, as the dyes do not always
<span class='pageno' title='120' id='Page_120'></span>penetrate equally, and if the work is delicate and
the design small, it is apt to change the colors to
rub them down. Napkin rings, breast pins,
masonic mallets and emblems generally, miniature
gothic chairs with carved backs for ornamental
purposes, chess and checker men, small boxes for
lip and eye salves, needle cases, thimble cases,
ring and jewel boxes, penholders, silk-winders,
card cases, all afford a fine opportunity for the
skill and taste of the amateur.</p>

<h3 id='section_xix_1' class='c014'>ORNAMENTAL DESIGNS FOR INLAYING.</h3>

<p class='c015'>Although a handsomely veined piece of wood
is as beautiful a thing as any one would wish to
see, there are occasionally pieces of work that
look well inlaid, and for this it is desirable that
we should have as pretty patterns and judiciously
chosen woods and contrasts as we can get.</p>

<p class='c006'>I give here what I think is a pretty design for
the cover of a round box. It is easily made, and
I venture to suggest that the following colors
will be found agreeable; No. 1, tulip with outside
edge of white holly, tulip to be cut across the
grain. No. 2, ebony cut out of a solid veneer,
that is not pieced. It will save a great deal of
time and labor to glue this veneer on to mahogany
a quarter of an inch thick, and then saw the
pattern out with a fine turn-saw. To get the
veneer off whole, soak it in warm water for a
few minutes. No. 3, boxwood. No. 4, ebony.
No. 5, tulip, or, if you can get it, turtle wood.
It is sometimes to be had of Henry A. Kerr,
Center street, New York, dealer in woods. The
<span class='pageno' title='122' id='Page_122'></span>central flower can be omitted or executed. It is
a good deal of work, but will make a beautiful
piece when well done. Turtle wood is very remarkable,
being yellow inclining to salmon,
mottled with brownish black streaks, sometimes
black with superb crimson markings, like a summer
sunset after a thunder storm.</p>

<p class='c006'><a href='#i135'>Fig. 76</a> is another similar pattern. Of course the
workman will make such disposition of the colors
as he pleases. When these are varnished and
French polished, they certainly look splendidly,
and are specimens of work that any one may be
proud of; of course supposing them to be well
fitted as to joints, and without the glairy, sticky
appearance that characterizes varnish half rubbed
down, and that worked before it has hardened.
Hardening and drying are two different things.
Varnish dries before it hardens, and requires time,
the more the better, to season, so it can be polished.
This is a very easy pattern to fit, and any one of
experience can make it complete in four or six
hours.</p>

<p class='c006'><a href='#i137'>Fig. 77</a> is still another pattern, but what is
shown dark, as at A, in the outer circles should
be light to represent tulip wood. Tulip contrasts
splendidly with ebony. The center or body of
the cover should be rosewood. This must be put
on first, all over the whole surface, and a white
<span class='pageno' title='123' id='Page_123'></span>holly ring put on the outside edge. The exterior
and interior circles, which form the pattern, are
then cut out by a tool like a carpenter’s bit used
in the lathe, as in this diagram. The letter <i>a</i> is
round, and will, of course, make a slight center
hole in the box cover, but as it is covered up that
is a matter of no moment. The inner circles B
should also be tulip, or some wood that contrasts
with ebony; mahogany is very handsome. This
pattern is not pretty, but it is striking and unique,
which is sometimes the same thing. Of course,
the distances of the circles must be determined
beforehand with a pair of compasses.</p>

<p class='c006'>In scroll sawing much can be done that is
pleasing to the eye in small works, but for large
designs and intricate ones, the amateur will find
an upright or jig saw necessary, unless he be more
than usually patient.</p>

<p class='c006'>For the joints of boxes before veneering I always
prefer screws rather than dovetailing, which
takes a long time, and is no better when done;
screws are sure, never start, and save time, which
is a great consideration with amateurs, whose
tasks are often, indeed, in nearly all cases, carried
on after some other labor is over, in the interim
between arduous toil.</p>

<p class='c006'>White woods, such as holly, need white glue,
else the joints will show. Beware of dust in your
<span class='pageno' title='124' id='Page_124'></span>varnish brush, and take care that you soak it for
half a day before using it, else the hairs will come
out on your work and ruin it. Flat, camel’s hair
brushes are to be used, and can be had in every
paint store. Use only the whitest copal varnish
for your white holly, else you will find it yellow
holly after the varnish has been put on. Most
varnishes need thinning slightly with turpentine
before use, especially if they have been kept some
time.</p>

<p class='c006'>Keep your lathe centers so that they run true
on the points at all times, and have a mark on
them so that they always enter from the same
side of the lathe mandrel.</p>

<p class='c006'>When you put clamps on to hold your veneers,
as you always should, be careful, if your wood is
soft, that you do not set the clamps so tight as to
sink the veneer into the lower wood, for the
result will be an uneven surface, that nothing can
remedy.</p>

<p class='c006'>Be careful to have clean glue and clean surfaces
if you wish to make sound work. Dust or grit
ruins glue so that it will not hold.</p>

<h3 id='section_xx_1' class='c014'>GENERAL SUMMARY.</h3>

<p class='c015'>In polishing metals, whether brass, iron, steel,
or of whatever nature, it is essential that the tool
marks and scratches of files, or other agents,
should be entirely removed before the final gloss
is given, otherwise the work will have a cheap
look that detracts very much from its appearance.</p>

<p class='c006'>If emery of the finest character (flour) is used,
with oil, the result will be very beautiful, but
this makes a mess about the lathe it is desirable
to avoid. Polish with oil is softer in appearance
than dry polishing, and is much more durable,
being not so liable to rust and tarnish. Dry
polishing is performed with sand paper of various
grades, running from ½ to 0. This gives a very
bright, dazzling finish, that is easily rusted.
Brass must be treated with rotten stone and oil to
be nicely polished, and after this the burnisher
should be used. Lacquers are employed for the
purpose of preserving the polish unimpaired, and
are made as follows:</p>

      <div class='line'>When dissolved add 30 drops Spirit of Turpentine.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'><i>Directions for Making.</i>—Mix the ingredients,
and let the vessel containing them stand in the
sun, or in a place slightly warmed, for three or
four days, shaking it frequently till the gum is
dissolved, after which let it settle from 24 to 48
hours, when the clear liquor may be poured off
for use. Pulverized glass is sometimes used in
making lacquers, to carry down the impurities.</p>

<p class='c015'>The best burnisher is a piece of bloodstone
ground to shape and set in a handle; they can be
bought for about a dollar and a half at any watchmakers’
<span class='pageno' title='127' id='Page_127'></span>tool store. Rouge powder is also an excellent
thing for polishing brass and German
silver. German silver, in wire, also in sheet, can
be had at the same place.</p>

<p class='c006'>For silver plating fluid the workman will find
that manufactured by Howe &amp; Stevens, Boston,
Massachusetts, to be the best of its class, as it
leaves a thin coating of pure silver on the metal,
which can be renewed from time to time, as it
wears, by a fresh application.</p>

<p class='c006'>Any articles that require to be gilt can be best
done by electro platers, who will deposit as much
gold on the surface as one desires, even to the
thirty-second part of an inch. It is better, however,
to buy a small battery, which can be had for
four or five dollars, and do this for yourself. Very
many other things can be electro-plated, and fac similes
of medals produced at a small cost, which
will be both instructive and ornamental.</p>

<h3 id='section_xx_3' class='c016'>SOLDERING.</h3>

<p class='c015'>There are many ways of soldering, but the
amateur will find the spirit lamp and the soldering
iron the most convenient and expeditious.</p>

<p class='c006'>In soldering tinned surfaces, no particular care
is needed, as the solder will adhere easily, but in
brass, or other metals, it does not do so without
the aid of a rosin flux or acid solution. These
<span class='pageno' title='128' id='Page_128'></span>simply act to make the surfaces chemically clean,
so that the solder will hold. In fact, cleanliness
is absolutely indispensable to success, for the
solder will crawl off of any thing that is dirty or
greasy, even though it may not appear to be so.
Lead and tin are used for solder, and can be
bought of any tinner very cheaply. The end of
the soldering iron (which is not iron, but copper,
by the way) should be tinned, otherwise the solder
will not hold on it, neither will it follow when
the iron is drawn along a seam.</p>

<p class='c006'>The iron is readily tinned in this way. File it
to the shape you want it, and put it in the fire,
heating it pretty hot, but nothing like redness.
You are then to wipe it clean quickly on a rag
wet with soldering fluid, which can be had in
drug stores, and is made of muriatic acid and
sheet zinc dissolved in the same; the zinc must
be clean, and in small strips, and shaken gradually
until dissolved. The solution must then be well
diluted with water. It is used by wetting the
rag aforesaid with it and rubbing the iron in it;
if block tin in strips be now rubbed on the end
of the iron, it will adhere, and the iron will be
ready for use. The iron must not be heated so as
to melt off the tin and expose the copper underneath;
for the iron is then useless until tinned
again.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' title='129' id='Page_129'></span>The soldering fluid is always to be used when
brass, or any surfaces not coated with tin, are to
be united.</p>

<p class='c006'>By the spirit lamp you can join metallic surfaces
very easily and quickly as follows: take
your plate, or whatever it is you wish to join together,
and scour it bright with fine sand-paper
or pumice stone and water, on the faces to be
united. Apply the soldering fluid, hold it over
the spirit lamp blaze, and as soon as it is well
heated, rub it over with a stick of tin; when it is
well tinned, lay it on a hot flat iron or the stove
for a minute, until you have tinned the other
piece, then clap both together, and they will set
instantly.</p>

<p class='c006'>The blowpipe is very convenient for soldering
small pieces together that cannot be touched with
the iron, but as it requires some skill to use it,
the amateur is not likely to be very successful
with it. The articles to be soldered in this way,
should be placed on a piece of charcoal, so that
the heat will be equally distributed and kept up
during the process.</p>

<h3 id='section_xx_4' class='c016'>VARNISHING AND POLISHING.</h3>

<p class='c015'>On no account is a second coat of varnish to be
applied before the first one is dry. If this <em>is</em> done
the result will be a sticky, ridgy, dirty looking
<span class='pageno' title='130' id='Page_130'></span>job. Before the work is varnished even, it must
be thoroughly sand-papered to remove inequalities,
and the last sand-papering should be with the
finest grade. Then apply the varnish, taking
care not to put too much on for the first coat.
When that is dry and <em>hard</em>, sand-paper with fine
paper again and varnish again. Three to four
coats are enough for ordinary work. When the
last coat is dry and hard, get some floated pumice
stone flour, that is, pumice stone flour that has
been washed, mix it with water to about the
thickness of cream; apply it to a woolen rag, and
rub it gently over the work; not too hard, for
that would cut the varnish off down to the wood.
After a while you will see that the surface of the
varnish begins to have a hard, smooth body, like
carriage work. When this occurs, you can wash
the pumice stone all off, and take a little Tripoli
or rotten stone and oil, and rub gently all over
the job; you will then have a surpassingly beautiful
and brilliant surface, that will show the
grain and vein of the wood to perfection. If you
desire the gloss that varnish gives, you must
apply a thin coat of wearing varnish after this.
In varnishing, you must buy “rubbing varnish”
if you intend to polish and oil varnish, not spirit,
which is apt to crack and rub up under the treatment.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' title='131' id='Page_131'></span>
<h3 id='section_xx_5' class='c016'>BRUSHES.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c015'>In varnishing, you, of course, desire to have a
true and even surface, without a ridge to show
where the brush left it. Camel’s hair flat brushes
are used for this purpose, but they will not answer
in spirit varnishes, as the hairs drop out or
are loosened from the action of the spirit on the
shellac or glue, which holds them in. Bristle
brushes are the best for general use. They must
be soaked for an hour or more in cold water, to
fasten the bristles before using.</p>

<h3 id='section_xx_6' class='c016'>PEARL.</h3>

<p class='c015'>This substance is easily sawed into shape, and
is easily turned with a common steel tool. It is
polished readily with pumice stone and water and
“putty powder,” this last to be had of chemists
or lapidaries. It is better to preserve the colored
surface as nature left it, for the beautiful rays
and tints presented by it are owing to a peculiar
disposition of thin scales on the surface, which retain
the light; if these be destroyed, the beauty
of the material is lost. It is to be had of marine
store keepers generally, or the amateur can get it
more readily of the nearest button manufacturer.</p>

<h3 id='section_xx_7' class='c016'>MISCELLANEOUS TOOLS.</h3>

<p class='c015'>If you buy any tools, always buy the best that
money can get. P. S. Stubs’ files, wire, rimmers,
<span class='pageno' title='132' id='Page_132'></span>and screw plates, are standard tools, and the amateur
cannot go astray in choosing them. A vise
is indispensable, and it should be large enough to
hold the work without springing.</p>

<h3 id='section_xx_8' class='c016'>CURVING MAPLE VENEERS.</h3>

<p class='c015'>If you wish to curve a veneer so that it will fit
a half or a whole circle, it is easily done by dipping
it in hot water, when it will instantly curl
up into any shape you want. I do this with bird’s
eye maple. This wood is easily stained any hue,
and is rather handsomer in chocolate brown than
in its natural color. It is then the nearest to
French oak of any wood that we have, and that is
unquestionably superb. Such markings and mottlings
as it has, surpass anything ever seen; it is
a deep, rich, chocolate brown color, full of snarls,
curves, and knots, not over five eights of an inch
in their largest diameters, and so beautiful that it
seems as if some hand must have arranged them.</p>

<p class='c006'>The French oak is susceptible of a splendid
polish, but I am unable to say how it works, for
I never worked any, nor do I know where to get
it. Curled maple will also take a handsome dye.
Get Howe &amp; Stevens’s Dye Colors in powder—they
can be had in any apothecary’s store, of
any shade—put it in an earthen dish and boil
it, then dip or sponge the veneer with it. The
<span class='pageno' title='133' id='Page_133'></span>color will strike through and through, and you
may sand-paper it as much as you please without
removing it. It is a very beautiful job to take a
plain ogee moulding and curl a bird’s eye maple
veneer on the round part, and an ebony veneer
on the fillet or hollow, and then varnish and
polish it. It makes one of the most beautiful
picture frames that ever was seen; having all the
effect of mouldings made from the solid wood.</p>

<h3 id='section_xx_9' class='c016'>CUTTING MISCELLANEOUS MATERIALS.</h3>

<p class='c015'>By these I mean horn jet, malachite, alabaster,
cannel coal, glass, and similar substances. For
all of these, except malachite, steel will answer,
but that steel will not touch. It is not a nice
material to work, being apt to check and crack in
the most unlooked-for manner. To those who
have never seen it, I will say that it is a stone, or
species of marble, obtained in Russia, and is green
in color, marked with white and greenish gray
stripes. The green is specially brilliant, and the
effect is very fine. Although it is so hard that steel
will not cut it, it is easily scratched in use, and is
a soft stone, and can be readily cut on a common
vulcanite emery wheel, and polished on a razor
strop covered with rouge powder. It is frequently
used for jewelry. Glass is easily filed in
a lathe with a common file, but I do not know
<span class='pageno' title='134' id='Page_134'></span>what any one should wish to work glass for, as it
is exceedingly dangerous from the splinters which
fly from it, is quite friable and easily broken, and
is, moreover, so common that no value attaches to
it. Very pretty vases can be made out of alabaster
by turning them in the lathe.</p>
